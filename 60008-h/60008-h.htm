<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c007'>MON</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Monument</span>, a noble fluted
column, erected by order of parliament,
in commemoration of the
burning and rebuilding of the city, on the
east side of Fish street hill, in a square
open to the street.</p>

<p class='c004'>This stately column, which is of the
Doric order, was begun by Sir Christopher
Wren, in the year 1671, and completed
by that great architect in 1677. It
much exceeds, in height, the pillars at
Rome of the Emperors Trajan and Antoninus,
the stately remains of Roman grandeur;
or that of Theodosius at Constantinople;
for the largest of the Roman columns,
which was that of Antoninus, was
only 172 feet and a half in height, and 12
feet 3 inches, English measure, in diameter.
But the diameter of this column
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>at the base, is 15 feet, and consequently
it is 120 feet high; the height of
the pedestal is 40, and the cippus or meta
with the urn on the top 42, making 202
feet in the whole. On the cap of the pedestal,
at the angles, are four dragons (the
supporters of the city arms) and between
them trophies, with symbols of regality,
arts, sciences, commerce, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c004'>Within is a large staircase of black
marble, containing 345 steps, 10 inches
and a half broad, and 6 inches in thickness,
and by these there is an ascent to the
iron balcony (which is the abacus of the
column). Over the capital is an iron balcony,
encompassing a cone 32 feet high,
supporting a blazing urn of brass, gilt.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the place of this urn, which was set
up contrary to Sir Christopher’s opinion,
was originally intended a colossal statue,
in brass, gilt, of King Charles II. as
founder of the new city, after the manner
of the Roman pillars, which terminated
with the statues of their Cæsars; or else a
figure erect of a woman crowned with
turrets, holding a sword and cap of maintenance,
with other ensigns of the city’s
grandeur and re-erection.</p>

<p class='c004'>Prior to this, the same gentleman made
a design of a pillar of somewhat less proportion,
viz. 14 feet in diameter, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>after a peculiar device: for as the Romans
expressed by <i>relievo</i> on the pedestals, and
round the shafts of their columns, the
history of such actions and incidents as
were intended to be thereby commemorated;
so this monument of the conflagration
and resurrection of the city of
London was represented by a pillar in
flames; the flames, blazing from the
loop-holes of the shaft, intended to give
light to the stairs within, were in brass
work gilt, and on the top was a phœnix
rising from her ashes, also of brass gilt.
<i>Parentalia.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>The west side of the pedestal is adorned
with curious emblems, by the masterly
hand of Mr. Cibber, father to the late
Poet Laureat, in which the eleven principal
figures are done in <i>alto</i>, and the rest
in <i>basso relievo</i>. The principal figure, to
which the eye is particularly directed, is a
female, representing the city of London,
sitting in a languishing posture on a heap
of ruins: her head droops, her hair is
dishevelled, and her hand, with an air of
languor, lies carelessly on her sword. Behind
is Time, gradually raising her up: at
her side, a woman, representing Providence,
gently touches her with one hand,
while with a winged scepter in the other,
she directs her to regard two Goddesses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>in the clouds, one with a cornucopia, denoting
Plenty, the other with a palm
branch, the emblem of Peace. At her
feet is a bee-hive, to shew that by industry
and application the greatest misfortunes
may be overcome. Behind Time,
are citizens exulting at his endeavours to
restore her; and, beneath, in the midst of
the ruins, is a dragon, the supporter of the
city arms, who endeavours to preserve
them with his paw. Still farther, at the
north end, is a view of the city in flames;
the inhabitants in consternation, with
their arms extended upward, and crying
out for succour.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the other side, on an elevated pavement,
stands King Charles II. in a Roman
habit, with his temples incircled by a
wreath of laurel, and approaching the figure
representing the city, with a truncheon
in his hand, seems to command three
of his attendants to descend to her relief:
the first represents the Sciences, with
wings on her head, and a circle of naked
boys dancing upon it, holding in her hand
Nature, with her numerous breasts ready
to give assistance to all: the second is,
Architecture, with a plan in one hand,
and a square and pair of compasses in the
other: and the third is, Liberty, waving
a hat in the air, shewing her joy at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>pleasing prospect of the city’s speedy recovery.
Behind the King, stands his brother
the Duke of York, with a garland in
one hand to crown the rising city, and a
sword in the other for her defence. Behind
him are Justice and Fortitude, the
former with a coronet, and the latter with
a reined lion. In the pavement, under
the Sovereign’s feet, appears Envy peeping
from her cell, and gnawing a heart;
and in the upper part of the back ground
the re-construction of the city is represented
by scaffolds, erected by the sides of
unfinished houses, with builders and labourers
at work upon them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The other sides of the pedestal have,
each, a Latin inscription. That on the
north side may be thus rendered.</p>
<p class='c009'>‘In the year of Christ 1666, the second
day of September, eastward from hence,
at the distance of 202 feet, (the height
of this column) about midnight, a most
terrible fire broke out, which, driven by
a high wind, not only laid waste the adjacent
parts, but also places very remote,
with incredible noise and fury: it consumed
89 churches, the city gates, Guildhall,
many public structures, hospitals,
schools, libraries, a vast number of stately
edifices, 13,200 dwelling houses, 400
streets: of twenty-six wards it utterly destroyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>fifteen, and left eight others
shattered and half burnt. The ruins of
the city were 436 acres, from the Tower
by the Thames side to the Temple
church, and from the north east, along
the city wall, to Holborn bridge. To
the estates and fortunes of the citizens
it was merciless, but to their lives very
favourable. That it might, in all things,
resemble the last conflagration of the
world, the destruction was sudden; for
in a small space of time, the same city
was seen most flourishing, and reduced
to nothing. Three days after, when
this fatal fire had, in the opinion of all,
baffled all human counsels and endeavours,
it stopped, as it were, by a command
from heaven, and was on every
side extinguished.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The inscription on the south side is
translated thus:</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Charles the Second, son of Charles
the Martyr, King of Great Britain,
France, and Ireland, Defender of the
Faith, a most gracious Prince, commiserating
the deplorable state of things,
whilst the ruins were yet smoaking, provided
for the comfort of his citizens,
and ornament of his city, remitted their
taxes, and referred the petition of the
magistrates and inhabitants to parliament;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>who immediately passed an act,
that public works should be restored to
greater beauty, with public money, to
be raised by an impost on coals; that the
churches, and the cathedral of St. Paul’s,
should be rebuilt from their foundations,
with the utmost magnificence: that
bridges, gates, and prisons should be new
erected, the sewers cleansed, the streets
made straight and regular, such as were
steep levelled, and those too narrow to
be made wider. Markets and shambles
removed to separate places. They also
enabled, that every house should be built
with party walls, and all in front raised
of equal height; that those walls should
be of square stone or brick; and that no
man should delay building beyond the
space of seven years. Moreover, care
was taken by law to prevent all suits about
their bounds. Anniversary prayers
were also enjoined; and to perpetuate
the memory thereof to posterity, they
caused this column to be erected. The
work was carried on with diligence, and
London is restored; but whether with
greater speed or beauty, may be made a
question. In three years time the world
saw that finished, which was supposed
to be the work of an age.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The inscription on the east side contains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the names of the Lord Mayors
from the time of its being begun, till its
being compleated; and round the upper
part of the pedestal is the following inscription
in English.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘This pillar was set up in perpetual
remembrance of the most dreadful
burning of this protestant city, begun
and carried on by the treachery and malice
of the popish faction in the beginning
of September, in the year of our
Lord 1666, in order to the carrying on
their horrid plot for extirpating the
protestant religion, and Old English Liberty,
and introducing popery and slavery.’</p>

<p class='c010'>This inscription, upon the Duke of
York’s accession to the crown, was immediately
erased; but soon after the revolution
it was restored again.</p>

<p class='c004'>This monument, says the author of
<i>The Review of our public buildings</i>, “is
undoubtedly the noblest modern column
in the world; nay, in some respects,
it may justly vie with those celebrated
ones of antiquity, which are
consecrated to the names of Trajan and
Antonine. Nothing can be more bold
and surprizing, nothing more beautiful
and harmonious: the bas relief at the
base, allowing for some few defects, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>finely imagined, and executed as well:
and nothing material can be cavilled
with but the inscriptions round about
it.” These, however, Sir Christopher
Wren had prepared in a more elegant
and masculine style, as appears by the
<i>Parentalia</i>; but he was over-ruled.</p>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Monument</span> <i>yard</i>, New Fish street hill,
so called from the Monument placed in
it.</p>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Moor</span> <i>court</i>, 1. Fore street, Cripplegate, so
called from its vicinity to Moorfields. 2.
Miles lane, near Crooked lane.</p>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Moorfields</span>, a large piece of ground to
the north of London wall, lying between
the east end of Fore street, and the west
end of New Broad street, and extending
as far as Hoxton. These fields originally
took their name from their being one continued
marsh or moor; so that Roger
Achiley, Lord Mayor, in 1521, caused
the ground to be levelled, and bridges
and causeways to be erected over these
fields, in order to render them passable: but
since that time the ground has been raised
and drained, and the whole encompassed
with houses.</p>

<p class='c004'>Moorfields being a very extensive piece
of ground, is now divided into Lower
Moorfields, Middle Moorfields, and Upper
Moorfields. The first of these divisions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>has the hospital of Bethlem, a noble
building, extending along the whole south
side: and here the fields are divided into
four different squares, by very strong, but
clumsey, wooden rails, each containing
a large grass plat, surrounded on each
side by a row of trees. Between these
squares, which are generally denominated
the quarters, are gravel walks; and one
extending from east to west, with a row
of trees on each side, forming a tolerable
vista, is usually denominated the City
Mall; a great concourse of well-dressed
citizens of both sexes walking there, particularly
every Sunday noon in fine
weather, and on evenings.</p>

<p class='c004'>The east side of this part of Moorfields
is taken up by shops, where old
books are sold at the south east corner,
and second-hand goods of all sorts along
that side.</p>

<p class='c004'>The rest of Moorfields, containing the
two other divisions, still lie waste, though
they might be converted into gardens or
public walks, and thus be rendered one
of the principal ornaments of this metropolis.</p>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Moorgate</span>, situated near the north end of
Coleman street, and 1664 feet to the
west of Bishopsgate, was first erected in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the year 1415, and received its name
from its opening into Moorfields.</p>

<p class='c004'>The present edifice, which is one of
the most magnificent gates of the city,
was erected in the year 1674, and consists
of a lofty arch, and two posterns for
foot passengers. The arch is built higher
than the common rules of proportion,
for the sake of the city trained bands
marching through it with their pikes
erected; a weapon now laid aside. Others,
however, are of opinion, that its
height was intended for the better convenience
of bringing carts or waggons
loaded with hay into the city, it having
been intended to make a market for hay
in Little Moorfields; a design which did
not take effect. The upper part is ornamented
with Corinthian pilasters, supporting
their proper entablature, and with a
round pediment, in which is the city
arms. The apartments over the gate are
appropriated to the use of one of the
Lord Mayor’s carvers.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Moor Park</span>, near Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire,
is at present the seat of Lord
Anson. The park is not large, but is
very beautiful, whether we consider it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>within itself or with regard to the fine
and extensive prospects from it. The
house was originally built by Cardinal
Wolsey, and, passing through many
hands, was afterwards in possession of
the Duke of Monmouth. Then it came
into the hands of Mr. Stiles, who enlarged,
repaired, and beautified it, under
the direction of Sir James Thornhill. It
stands on a hill, not quite on the summit.
It is of stone of the Corinthian order;
and, if not in the highest stile of
architecture, is yet very noble. The
south, or principal front, has a portico
and pediment of four columns. The
offices are joined to the house by a beautiful
circular colonade of the Ionic order,
which terminates very elegantly with
domes on each side their entrance. One
cannot help wishing the house on the top
of the hill, or that part of the hill were
removed, for you can’t now see the principal
front till you are upon it. Even
in the view given in the print, part of
one of the wings is hid by the rising
ground.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Morden College</span>, on the east side of
Blackheath, for the support of poor decayed
and honest merchants, was erected
by Sir John Morden, Bart. a Turky merchant,
several years before his death,
which happened in the year 1708. It
consists of a large brick building, with
two small wings, strengthened at the corners
with stone rustic. The principal
entrance, which is in the center, is decorated
with Doric columns, festoons,
and a pediment on the top, over which
rises a turret, with a dial; and from the
dome, which is supported by scrolls, rises
a ball and fane. To this entrance there
is an ascent by a flight of circular steps;
and having ascended them, and passed
through this part of the building, we enter
an inner square, surrounded with piazzas.
The chapel is neatly wainscoted,
and has a costly altar-piece.</p>

<p class='c004'>This structure Sir John erected at a
small distance from his own habitation,
in a place called Great Stone Field, and
endowed it, after his Lady’s decease, with
his whole real, copyhold, and personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>estate, to the value of about 1300<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The founder of this noble charity
placed in this hospital twelve decayed
Turky merchants in his life time; but
after his decease, the Lady Morden, finding
that the share allotted her by Sir
John’s last will was insufficient for her
decent support, some parts of the estate
not answering so well as was expected,
she was obliged to reduce the number to
four.</p>

<p class='c004'>But upon her death the whole estate
coming to the college, the number was
increased, and there are at this time
thirty-five poor gentlemen; and, the
number not being limited, it is to be increased
as the estate will afford; for the
building will conveniently hold forty.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Treasurer, who receives the rents
and revenues, and keeps the books of
the accounts and disbursements of the
college, has 40<i>l.</i> a year; and the Chaplain,
who reads prayers twice a day, and
preaches twice every Sunday, had at first
a salary of 30<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>, which the
Lady Morden doubled at her death.
She was, in other respects, a benefactress
of the college, and, as she put up her
husband’s statue in a niche, over the gate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the trustees put up her’s in another niche,
adjoining to that of her husband. The
pensioners have each 20<i>l.</i> a year, and at
first wore gowns, with the founder’s
badge; but this badge has not been worn
for some years. They have a common
table in the hall to eat and drink together
at meals; and each has a convenient
apartment, with a cellar.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Treasurer, Chaplain, and Pensioners,
are obliged to reside in the college;
and, except in case of sickness, no other
persons are to reside, live, or lodge
there; but no person can be admitted as
a pensioner, who cannot bring a certificate
to prove his being upwards of sixty
years of age.</p>

<p class='c004'>Seven Turky merchants have the direction
of this hospital, and the nomination
of the persons to be admitted into
it; to them the Treasurer is accountable;
and whenever any of these die, the surviving
trustees chuse others in their room.

<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>all affairs relating to the royal navy are
managed by the Commissioners under the
Lords of the Admiralty. It is a very plain
building, that by its appearance gives us
no idea of its importance; but it must be
allowed the merit of being extremely
convenient. The office where the Commissioners
meet, and the clerks keep their
books, is detached from the rest, as a
precaution against accidents by fire, the
papers here being of the utmost importance;
and in the other buildings some of
the Commissioners and other officers reside.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Treasurer of the navy is an officer
of prodigious trust, as he receives and
pays all sums for the use of the navy: his
salary is therefore 2000<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>, and
800<i>l.</i> for his instruments.</p>

<p class='c004'>The seven Commissioners have all their
different departments in the management
of the business of this office; and each
has a salary of 500<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p class='c004'>One is Comptroller of the navy: he
attends and comptrols all payments of
wages; is obliged to know the market
price of all stores belonging to shipping,
and to examine and audit all the treasurers,
victuallers, and storekeepers accounts.
This Commissioner has two clerks
who have 100<i>l.</i> a year each: one of 60<i>l.</i>
a year, and nine of 50<i>l.</i> each. Besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>in his office for seamen’s wages he has a
chief clerk who has 200<i>l.</i> a year, and also
nine others of 50<i>l.</i> each.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two others are Joint-surveyors of the
navy, and besides the salary of 500<i>l.</i> a
year each, one of them has 80<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>
for house rent. They are in general to
know the state of all stores, and to see
the wants supplied; to survey the hulls,
masts, and yards, and to estimate the value
of repairs by indenture; to charge all
boatswains and carpenters of the navy
with what stores they have received;
and at the end of each voyage to state and
audit their accounts. They have a chief
clerk, who has 100<i>l.</i> a year, and six others
of 50<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>The fourth is Clerk of the acts. It is
his office to record all orders, contracts,
bills, warrants, and other business transacted
by the principal officers and commissioners
of the navy. He has an assistant,
who has a salary of 300<i>l.</i> a year,
and 50<i>l.</i> for house rent; a chief clerk,
who has 100<i>l.</i> a year; another has 70<i>l.</i>
another 60<i>l.</i> and nine others have 50<i>l.</i>
<i>per annum</i> each.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fifth is Comptroller of the Treasurer’s
accounts, and has a clerk of 100<i>l.</i>
a year; another of 60<i>l.</i> another of 50<i>l.</i>
and another of 40<i>l.</i> a year. The ticket
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>office is under his inspection, and there
he has two chief clerks of 200<i>l.</i> a year
each; another of 80<i>l.</i> six of 50<i>l.</i> a year
each, and one of 40<i>l.</i> In this office
there are also six extra clerks who have
50<i>l.</i> a year each, and one who has
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sixth is the Comptroller of the
victualling accounts, who has a clerk of
100<i>l.</i> a year; one of 50<i>l.</i> and one of
40<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The seventh is Comptroller of the store-keeper’s
accounts, who has also a chief
clerk, that has a salary of 100<i>l.</i> a year;
six clerks of 50<i>l.</i> a year each; and another
of 40<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Besides these there are three Extra
Commissioners of the navy, who have
500<i>l.</i> a year, and 80<i>l.</i> each for house
rent; and under these are several clerks,
and other officers.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is also a Commissioner residing
at Gibraltar, who has 1000<i>l.</i> a year, and
several officers who have considerable salaries
under him: a Commissioner resident
at Chatham yard, at Portsmouth
yard, and at Plymouth yard, who have
500<i>l.</i> a year each; but Deptford and
Woolwich yards are under the immediate
inspection of the navy board; as Sheerness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>yard is under the inspection of the
Commissioner at Chatham.</p>

<p class='c004'>The number of these Officers and
Commissioners have been increased on
account of the exigence of affairs; but
the principal of them hold their offices by
patent under the great seal.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Newgate</span>, is situated 1037 feet south west
from Aldersgate, and is thought by most
Antiquarians, to be so denominated from
its being first erected in the reign of
Henry I. several ages after the four original
gates of the city: Howel is however
of a contrary opinion, and asserts that
it was only repaired in the above reign,
and that it was anciently denominated
Chamberlain gate; tho’ it is very extraordinary,
that this gate is not once mentioned
before the conquest. But be this
as it will, it appears from ancient records,
that it was called Newgate, and was a
common jail for felons taken in the city
of London, or the county of Middlesex,
so early as the year 1218; and that so
lately as the year 1457, Newgate, and
not the Tower, was a prison for the nobility
and great officers of state.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length Newgate being much damaged
by the fire of London in 1666,
the present beautiful structure was erected.
The west side is adorned with three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>ranges of Tuscan pilasters, with their entablatures,
and in the inter-columniations
are four niches, in one of which is
a figure representing Liberty; the word
<i>Libertas</i> is inscribed on her cap, and at
her feet lies a cat, in allusion to Sir
Richard Whittington, a benefactor to the
prison, who is said to have made the first
step to his good fortune by a cat.</p>

<p class='c004'>The inside of the gate is also adorned
with a range of pilasters, with their entablatures,
and in three niches are the
figures of Justice, Mercy and Truth.</p>

<p class='c004'>The author of <i>The Review</i> observes,</p>
<p class='c009'>“That Newgate considered as a prison,
is a structure of more cost and beauty
than was necessary, because the sumptuousness
of the outside but aggravates
the misery of the wretches within:
but as a gate to such a city as London,
it might have received considerable
additions both of design and execution,
and abundantly answered the cost in
the reputation of building. The gate
of a city erected rather for ornament
than use, ought to be in the style of
the ancient triumphal arches; and it
must be allowed, that hardly any kind
of building, admits of more beauty or
perfection.”</p>

<p class='c010'>If Newgate be considered as a prison,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>it is indeed a very dismal one. It is the
county jail for Middlesex, both for debtors
and malefactors, as well as the city
prison for criminals. The debtor rendered
unfortunate by the vicissitudes of trade,
or unforeseen losses, has the reproach of
being confined in the same prison with the
greatest villains; and too often his being
in Newgate is imputed by the ignorant to
crimes which he abhors. On the other
hand, those confined as criminals, are,
even before they are found guilty by the
laws of their country, packed so close together,
that the air being corrupted by
their stench and nastiness, occasions a dismal
contagious disease, called the Jail
distemper, which has frequently carried
off great numbers, and even spread its
contagion to the Court of Justice, where
they take their trials. But to prevent
these dreadful effects the city has introduced
a ventilator on the top of Newgate,
to expel the foul air, and make way for
the admission of such as is fresh; and during
the sessions herbs are also strewed in
the Justice Hall, and the passages to it,
to prevent infection.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this prison there are however commodious
and airy apartments for the use
of such as are able to pay for them; and
the advantage of a private passage behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the houses to Justice Hall in the Old Bailey,
where they are in no danger of being
rescued, while going to, or coming
back from their trials. It is to
be wished that this prison was made
still more commodious; that the little
cells of the malefactors were enlarged
and rendered more airy, and that the
proposal so often talked of, of building
another prison for the debtors, was carried
into execution.</p>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Newgate Market</span>, before the dreadful
fire of London, was kept in Newgate
street, where there was a market house
for meal, and a middle row of sheds,
which Maitland says, were afterwards
converted into houses, inhabited by butchers,
tripesellers, &amp;c. while the country
people, who brought provisions to the
city, were forced to stand with their stalls
in the open street, where their persons
and goods were exposed to danger by the
passage of coaches, carts, and cattle that
passed through the streets. This must
be allowed to have been a very inconvenient
market, and the houses or sheds in
the middle of the street, must almost
have choaked up the passage, or at least
have rendered it liable to frequent obstructions.
At that time Butcher hall
lane was filled with slaughter houses for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the use of this market, and Blowbladder
street was rendered remarkable by blown
bladders hanging in the windows of the
shops, where bladders were sold.</p>

<p class='c004'>After the fire of London, which afforded
an opportunity of rendering the
new streets more commodious than the
old ones had been, it was ordered by act
of parliament that Newgate market should
be removed from the street, and a square
was formed on the south side for that purpose,
surrounded by decent houses. This
square is 194 feet long from east to west,
and 148 feet broad from north to south.
In the middle is a market house, under
which are vaults or cellars, and the upper
part of the building is employed as a kind
of warehouse for the fruiterers, and the
keepers of green stalls by night. In the shops
under this building tripe and other things
are sold, and in the middle near the market
house are sold fruit and greens. At a convenient
distance are shops for butchers, the
sellers of butter, &amp;c. and the houses beyond
these, which extend along the sides
of the market, are also taken up by butchers.
It may be proper to observe with
respect to the butter shops, that some of
these contract for the produce of several
dairies, and that it is not uncommon for
one of these shops to take 30 or 40<i>l.</i> for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>butter alone, in a morning, even before
eight or nine o’clock. The passages to
the market from Paternoster row and
Newgate street, are taken up with poulterers,
bacon shops, fishmongers, and
cheesemongers.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>England, in the reign of King Henry VIII.

Norfolk, who had an estate here. The
Drapers and Fishmongers company have
almshouses here: and Mr. Whatley observes,
that here were planted the first
peaches so much esteemed, distinguished
by the name of Newington peaches. The

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>New River.</span> Various were the projects in
the reigns of Queen Elizabeth, and King
James I. for supplying the city of London
with a sufficient quantity of water,
for domestic uses: the former granted an
act of parliament, which gave the citizens
liberty to cut and convey a river from any
part of Middlesex or Hertfordshire to the
city of London, within the limited time
of ten years; and the latter granted another
act, in which they obtained the same
power, but without being confined to
any limited time: nobody however began
this great and important work, till
at last Sir Hugh Middleton undertook to
bring a river from Amwell in Hertfordshire
to the north side of London near
Islington.</p>

<p class='c004'>The work began on the 20th of September
1608, and was attended with innumerable
difficulties. The distance from
London is twenty miles, and he was
obliged, in order to avoid the eminences
and vallies in the way, to make it run a
course of thirty-eight miles three quarters
and sixteen poles, and to carry it over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>two vallies in long wooden frames or
troughs lined with lead; that at Buthill,
being six hundred and sixty feet in length,
and thirty in height; under which, for
the passage of the land waters is an arch
capacious enough to admit under it the
largest waggon laden with hay, or straw:
the other near Highbury is four hundred
and sixty-two feet long, and seventeen in
height, where it is raised along the top
of high artificial banks, and at the bottom
of the hollow supported by poles, so
that any person may walk under it. In
short over and under this river, which
sometimes rises thus high, and at others
is conveyed under ground, runs several
considerable currents of land waters, and
both above and below it a great number
of brooks, rills, and water courses have
their passage.</p>

<p class='c004'>This river, which is of inestimable
benefit to London, was by this truly great
man brought to the city within the space
of five years, and was admitted into the
reservoir near Islington on Michaelmas
day 1613; on which day Sir Thomas
Middleton, brother to the great Sir Hugh,
was elected Lord Mayor for the ensuing
year, who accompanying Sir John Swinerton,
then Lord Mayor, attended by many
of the Aldermen, the Recorder, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>other gentlemen, repaired to the bason, now
called New River Head, when about sixty
labourers, handsomely dressed, and wearing
green caps, carrying spades, shovels,
and pickaxes, marched, preceded by drums
and trumpets, thrice round the bason,
when stopping before the Lord Mayor,
Aldermen, and other gentlemen, who
were seated upon an eminence, one of
the labourers addressed himself to them
in a long copy of verses, which being
ended, the sluices were opened, and the
stream ran plentifully into the reservoir,
under the sound of drums and trumpets,
the discharge of several pieces of ordnance,
and the loud acclamations of the
people.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir Hugh Middleton, to enable himself
to complete this grand work, had at last,
after spending his own fortune, been
obliged to apply to King James I. who advancing
a sum of money became entitled
to a moiety of the profits; he was also
obliged to sell many other shares, and in
short, was in a manner entirely ruined by
a project, that has been attended with
unspeakable benefit to this city: since by
the water of this river, a speedy stop has
been put to a great number of dreadful
fires, and the health of the city has been
remarkably preserved by the cleanliness it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>has introduced among us. Yet so little
was the great advantages that might then,
and are now derived from this river, at
that time understood, that for above thirty
years there were not divided above 5<i>l.</i>
odd money, to each of the shares, which
are seventy-two in number.</p>

<p class='c004'>This river now draws most of its water
from the Lee, which being the property
of the city of London, that corporation,
contrary to the interest of the city in
general, opposed a bill brought into parliament
for giving farther powers to the
New River company, to take the advantage
that might be obtained by the river
Lee: but the opposition was without
effect, and in 1738–9 the bill passed into
a law.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Governors of the New River
company then agreed with the proprietors
of the lands on the river Lee for a
cut of two cubic feet of water from that
river, at a certain rate; and after the
agreement, told them they would double
the price for a four foot cut, which the
proprietors agreed to, not considering the
great disproportion between the two cuts;
and this cut of the river Lee now supplies
the largest share of the New River
water.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this river there are forty three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>sluices, and over it two hundred and
fifteen bridges. On its approaching the
reservoir, called New River Head,
there are several small houses erected at a
considerable distance from each other on
its banks, into which the water runs and
is conveyed by pipes to the nearer and
more easterly parts of this metropolis.
On its entering the above reservoir, it is
there ingulphed by fifty-eight main pipes,
each of seven inches bore; and here also
an engine worked by horses, throws a
great quantity of water up to another reservoir,
situated on much higher ground,
from which the water runs in pipes to
supply the highest ground in the city, and
its liberties. Many years ago 30,000
houses were thus supplied by this water,
and since that time several main pipes have
been laid to carry it into the liberties of
Westminster.</p>

<p class='c004'>This corporation consists of a Governor,
Deputy Governor, Treasurer, and
twenty-six Directors, these twenty-nine
are the proprietors of the first thirty-six
shares: for though the Crown’s moiety
is in private hands, yet they have no share
in the management. The above Governor
and Directors keep their office at a
coffee-house in Ludgate street where every
Thursday they hold a board for appointing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of officers, granting of leases, and redressing
of grievances.</p>

<p class='c004'>The officers and servants belonging to
the company are, a clerk and his assistant;
a surveyor and his deputy; fourteen
collectors, who, after deducting 5<i>l.</i> <i>per
cent.</i> for collecting the company’s rents,
pay their money every Thursday to the
treasurer; fourteen walksmen, who have
their several walks along the river, to prevent
throwing into it filth, or infectious
matter; sixteen turncocks; twelve paviours;
twenty borers of pipes; besides
horse engines for boring of others, together
with a great number of inferior servants
and labourers.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Nicholas Acons</span>, a church which
stood on the west side of Nicholas lane,
in Langbourn ward, owed its name to
its dedication to St. Nicholas, a citizen of
Lycia in Asia Minor, who, though only
a private housekeeper, was, from the caprice
of the electors, chosen Bishop of
Myræa; for the Bishops and Priests interested
in the election not agreeing about

that whatever person should first
enter the church the next day, should
be elected Bishop: when Nicholas repairing
early next morning, to perform
his devotions, being the first that entered,
was chosen Bishop, pursuant to the above
resolution; in which office his deportment
was such, as to procure him a place
among the class of saints.</p>

<p class='c004'>The church being destroyed with most

to the above-mentioned saint, but
the reason of the additional epithet is not
known, some conjecturing that it is a
corruption of Golden Abbey, and others
that it is derived from Cold Abbey, or
Coldbey, from its cold or bleak situation.
It is known that there was a church in the
same place before the year 1383: but the
last structure being consumed in the great
conflagration in 1666, the present church
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>was built in its place, and the parish of

decently ornamented. It is sixty-three
feet long, and forty-three broad;
thirty-six feet high to the roof, and an

with rustic at the corners; and the
spire, which is of the massy kind, has a

bushels of coals a year. This charity he
committed in trust to the company of
Salters; the house was however destroyed

was soon after rebuilt, and each widow
allowed two neat rooms and a garret.

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Nonesuch</span>, in Surry, is situated near Sutton
and Epsom, and was formerly called Cuddington,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>till a most magnificent palace
was erected there, by Henry VIII. which
obtained the name of Nonesuch from its
unparallelled beauty. The learned Hentzner,
in his <i>Itinerarium</i>, speaking of this
palace, says, that it was chosen for his
pleasure and retirement, and built by him
with an excess of magnificence and elegance
even to ostentation: one would
imagine every thing that architecture can
perform to have been employed in this
one work: there are every where so many
statues that seem to breathe, so many
miracles of consummate art, so many casts
that rival even the perfection of Roman
antiquity, that it may well claim and justify
its name of Nonesuch.</p>

<p class='c004'>The palace itself is so encompassed with
parks full of deer, delightful gardens,
groves ornamented with trellis work,
cabinets of verdure, and walks so embrowned
by trees, that it seems to be a
place pitched upon by Pleasure herself, to
dwell in along with Health.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the pleasure and artificial gardens
are many columns and pyramids of marble,
two fountains that spout water one round
the other, like a pyramid, upon which
are perched small birds that stream water
out of their bills: in the grove of Diana
is a very agreeable fountain, with Actæon
turned into a stag, as he was sprinkled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>by the goddess and her nymphs, with inscriptions.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is besides another pyramid of
marble full of concealed pipes, which spirt
upon all who come within their reach.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such was this palace and gardens when
Hentzner wrote, but King Charles II. gave
it to the Duchess of Cleveland, who pulled
it down and sold the materials; wherewith
a new house was built by the Earl
of Berkley, which was the seat of the late
Earl of Guildford, and is now called Durdans;
and Nonesuch, though it gives the
title of Baron to the Duke of Cleveland,
is now only a farm house.</p>

<p><i>Northumberland House &amp; Charing Cross.</i><br /><i>S. Wale delin.</i>      <i>J. Green sc. Oxon.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Northumberland House</span>, derives its
name from the title of the ancient and noble
family, in whose possession it has been
above 100 years. It is the town residence
of the Right Honourable the Earl and
Countess of Northumberland, and one of
the largest and most magnificent houses
in London. It was originally built very
early in the reign of James I. by Henry
Howard Earl of Northampton; and it is
reasonable to infer from some letters discovered
in the front when it was lately rebuilt,
that one Miles Glover was the
architect.</p>

<p class='c004'>At first it consisted only of three sides
of a square; one of which faced the street
near Charing Cross, and the other two
extended towards the Thames. The entrance
was then, as it is now, thro’ a spacious
arched gateway for coaches in the
middle of the street front; and, what
is remarkable, the principal apartments
were in the third or highest story. During
the life of the aforesaid Lord, it was
called Northampton House, after his death
it became the property of his near relation
the Earl of Suffolk; in whose time it does
not appear to have undergone any change
except in name; for it was thereupon called
Suffolk House.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>In the reign of Charles I. Algernon
Earl Of Northumberland, the Lord High
Admiral of England, married Lord Suffolk’s
daughter, and about the year
1642, became the proprietor of this
house; from which time it has been well
known by the name it now bears. To
prevent mistakes, we beg leave to observe,
that the Northumberland House, which
is often mentioned in history before this
period, stood in Aldersgate ward in the
city, and was formerly, what this house
is at present, the town seat of the Earls
of Northumberland. But to return.</p>

<p class='c004'>When London became more populous,
and the buildings about Charing Cross
daily increased, ‘twas found inconvenient
to live in the apartments, which had
been built by Lord Northampton; because
they were greatly disturbed by the
hurry and noise of passengers and coaches
in the street. To avoid therefore that
inconvenience, the aforesaid Earl of
Northumberland compleated the square
by building the fourth side; which being
parallel and opposite to that next the
street, is placed at a sufficient distance
from the aforesaid disturbances, and almost
enjoys all the advantages of retirement
and a country seat. Inigo Jones
appears to have been the architect employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>for that purpose, and the front of
the new side, which he built facing the
garden, is very grand and stately, as the
reader may see from the perspective view
of it, annexed to this account.</p>

<p class='c004'>Perhaps it will please some of our readers
to be informed, that Lord Northumberland
received General Monk, and had
a conference with him and several of the
leading men in the nation in one of these
apartments. At which meeting the King’s
restoration was for the first time proposed
in direct terms, as a measure absolutely
necessary to the peace of the
kingdom.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the year 1682, Charles Duke of
Somerset married the Lady Elizabeth
Percy, the daughter and heiress of Josceline
Earl of Northumberland, and by
that means became possessed of this
house. Upon his death it descended to
his son Algernon, by the aforesaid Lady,
who succeeded to the title and a very
large estate in 1748. His Grace immediately
began to make alterations in some
of the apartments, and to rebuild the
front next the street; but, dying the
year after, he did not live sufficient time
to finish either.</p>

<p class='c004'>The house in that condition, descended
to his son-in-law and daughter, the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Earl and Countess of Northumberland;
and it is in a great measure owing
to the improvements, made by them at
a very great expence and in a very fine
taste, that Northumberland House is become
a building so complete and stately, as
to be generally admired for its elegance
and grandeur.</p>

<p class='c004'>The street was immediately made
wider, and the front next to it compleated,
as it appears in the print prefixed to
this description. The four sides of the
court were new faced with Portland stone,
and finished in the Roman stile of architecture,
so as to form as it were four
stately fronts. Two new wings were also
added, being above 100 feet in length,
and extending from the garden front, towards
the Thames. By means of these
additions Northumberland House is more
than twice as large as it was, when first
built by Lord Northampton.</p>

<p class='c004'>The entrance into it is on the side of
the court opposite to the great gateway;
the vestibule is about 82 feet long, and
more than 12 feet broad, being properly
ornamented with columns of the Doric order.
Each end of it communicates with
a stair case, leading to the principal apartments,
which face the garden and the
Thames. They consist of several spacious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>rooms, fitted up in the most elegant
manner. The ceilings are embellished
with copies of antique paintings, or fine
ornaments of stucco, richly gilt. The
chimney pieces consist of statuary and
other curious marble, carved and finished
in the most correct taste. The rooms
are hung either with beautiful tapestry or
the richest damasks, and magnificently
furnished with large glasses, chairs, settees,
marble tables, &amp;c. with frames
of the most exquisite workmanship, and
richly gilt. They also contain a great
variety of landscapes, history pieces, and
portraits, painted by Titian and the most
eminent masters. In some of the rooms
may be seen large chests, embellished
with old genuine japan; which being
great rarities, are almost invaluable.</p>

<p class='c004'>The company passes thro’ many of these
apartments to the left wing, which forms
a state gallery or ball room, admirable in
every respect, whether we consider the
dimensions, the taste, and masterly manner
in which it is finished, or the
elegant magnificence of the furniture.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is 106 feet long, the breadth being
a fourth part of the length, and the
height equal to the diagonal of the square
of the breadth; which proportions are
esteemed to be the most proper for a gallery.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>The ceiling is coved and ornamented
with figures and festoons richly gilt. To
avoid repetitions, we beg leave once
for all to say the same of the other
decorations and frames of the furniture;
for there is such a variety of gilding
in the different parts of the gallery,
that it would be endless to mention it in
every particular description. But to proceed,
the flat part of the ceiling is divided
into five compartments, ornamented with
fine imitations of some antique figures,
as, a flying Fame blowing a trumpet; a
Diana; a triumphal car drawn by two
horses; a Flora; and a Victory holding
out a laurel wreath. The entablature is
Corinthian, and of most exquisite workmanship.
The light is admitted thro’
nine windows in the side next the garden,
being equidistant from one another,
and in the same horizontal direction.
Above these is another row of windows,
which, tho’ not visible in the room, are
so artfully placed as to throw a proper
quantity of light over the cornice, so that
the highest parts of the room are as much
enlightened as the lowest, and the pictures
on the opposite side are free from
that confused glare, which would arise
from a less judicious disposition. In the
spaces between the windows, there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>tables of antique marble, and stools covered
with crimson damask, placed alternately.
The piers are also ornamented
with large square and oval glasses, arranged
in the aforesaid order; the frames of
which form a beautiful variety of foliage
to adorn the higher parts quite up to the
entablature.</p>

<p class='c004'>Let us now pass over to the opposite
side, which is divided into three large
spaces by two chimney pieces made of statuary
marble, with cornices supported by
figures of Phrygian captives, copied from
those in the Capitol at Rome, and executed
in a very masterly manner. The finishing
above the chimney pieces consists of
terms, sphinxes, festoons, &amp;c. and within
the spaces formed by these ornaments
are placed whole length portraits of the
Earl and Countess of Northumberland in
their robes.</p>

<p class='c004'>That the three grand divisions of this side
might be furnished in an elegant manner,
his Lordship employed the most eminent
masters to copy five of the most admired
paintings in Italy, which are placed as
follows: in the middle and largest division
is Raphael’s celebrated school of Athens,
copied from the original in the Vatican by
Raphael Mengs. In the two other divisions
on the right and left hand side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of the former are placed the feast and
council of the Gods, which were also
painted by Raphael, and copied by
Pompeio Battoni from the originals in the
Little Farnese. The two ends of the
gallery are ornamented with the triumphal
procession of Bacchus and Ariadne (originally
painted by Annibal Caracci in the
Farnese palace) and Guido’s Aurora. The
former was copied by Felice Costansi, and
the latter by Masuccio, a scholar of Carlo
Maratti, from the original in the Villa
Rospigliosi. All these pictures are very
large, being exactly of the same dimensions
with the originals, and are copied in a
very masterly manner. We heartily wish
his Lordship’s taste in procuring them
may incite those, who can afford it, to
follow the example, and purchase copies
of such paintings as are universally admired;
for by these means not only private
curiosity would be gratified, but
the public taste also greatly improved.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under the aforesaid pictures are placed
large sophas, covered with crimson damask
and richly ornamented. This gallery is
lighted up for the reception of company
in the evenings, by means of four glass
lustres, consisting in all of as many
branches as will receive 100 large wax
candles, and suspended from the ceiling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>by long chains, magnificently gilt. We
shall close our imperfect account of this
stately gallery, by wishing that it was in
the power of words to describe the fine
effects, which arise from a view of its
numberless beauties.</p>

<p class='c004'>Besides the apartments already mentioned,
there are above 140 rooms more
in this house; which, being so numerous,
and chiefly appropriated to the private
uses of the family, cannot be particularly
described in a work of this nature; however,
we must add, that Lord and Lady
Northumberland’s apartments are very
commodious and elegantly furnished; her
Ladyship’s closet is even a repository of
curiosities, and, amongst other valuable
things, contains so fine a collection of
pictures, as to afford a most pleasing and
almost endless entertainment to a connoisseur.
The two libraries also consist of a
great variety of books on the most useful
and curious subjects, collected with judgement.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have hitherto endeavoured to give
some idea of the gradual improvements,
by which Northumberland House acquired
its present grandeur and magnificence;
but we cannot take our leave of it without
conducting, as it were, the reader
into the garden, where he may enjoy the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>quiet and tranquility of the country amidst
the noise and distraction of the town, and
contrast the simple beauties of nature, with
the stately productions of art.</p>

<p class='c004'>It lies between the house and the
Thames, and forms a pleasing piece of
scenery before the principal apartments;
for it consists of a fine lawn surrounded
with a neat gravel walk, and bounded
next the walls by a border of curious
flowers, shrubs and ever-greens. At the
end of the garden beyond the wall, were
a few buildings which his Lordship ordered
to be taken down, to open a larger
prospect across the Thames to Southwark,
and into the country behind it. And, as
the horizon is finely diversified with
hills, which when every thing is compleated,
will appear as it were in the back
scene, the view will command a very
beautiful landscape.</p>

Norway, who from his strong attachment
to the Christian religion, took part
in the disputes with the English and
Danes; for this, together with his supporting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Christianity in his own dominions,
and his sufferings on that account, he
stands sainted in the Roman calendar.</p>

<p class='c004'>A church stood in the same place, dedicated
to the same royal patron, before
the year 1319. The present structure is
of considerable antiquity, for it escaped
the flames in 1666, and since that time
has had several repairs and additions,
among which last is the portico; this
is no small ornament, though it is not
well adapted to the edifice. This portico
was added in the year 1674.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is a mixed building, with respect
to its materials, as well as its form, part
being of square stone, part of irregular
stone, and part of brick. The body,
which is square, is fifty-four feet in
length, and the same in breadth; the
height of the roof is thirty feet, and that
of the steeple sixty. The windows are
large and gothic, and every thing plain
except the portico, which is formed
of Corinthian pilasters, with an arched
pediment. The tower, which consists
of a single stage above the roof, is also
extremely plain, and the turret wherewith
it is crowned is well proportioned.</p>

<p class='c004'>The patronage of this rectory has all
along been in private hands. The Incumbent,
besides several annual donations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>and other profits, receives 120<i>l.</i> a year in
tithes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Weaver in his funeral monuments,

<p class='c015'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Olave’s Jewry</span>, situated on the west
side of the Old Jewry, in Coleman street
ward, was anciently denominated St.
Olave’s Upwell, from its dedication to the
saint of that name, and probably from a
well under the east end, wherein a pump
is now placed; but that gave way to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>name of Jewry, owing to this neighbourhood’s
becoming the principal residence of
the Jews in this city.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here was a parish church so early as
the year 1181; the last sacred edifice
was destroyed by the fire of London, and
the present finished in 1673. It consists
of a well enlightened body, seventy-eight
feet in length, and twenty-four in breadth;
the height to the roof is thirty-six feet,
and that of the tower and pinacles
eighty-eight. The door is well proportioned,
and of the Doric order, covered
with an arched pediment. On the upper
part of the tower, which is very plain,
rises a cornice supported by scrolls; and
upon this plain attic course, on the pillars
at the corners, are placed the pinacles,
standing on balls, and each terminated on
the top by a ball.</p>

<p class='c004'>This church, tho’ anciently a rectory,
is now a vicarage in the gift of the Crown;
and the parish of St. Martin, Ironmonger
lane, is now united to it, by which the
Incumbent’s profits are considerably increased;
he receives besides other profits,
120<i>l.</i> a year in lieu of tithes.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Olave’s</span> <i>Silver street</i>, stood at the south
west corner of Silver street, in Aldersgate
ward; but being consumed by the fire
of London, and not rebuilt, the parish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>is annexed to the neighbouring church of
St. Alban’s Wood street.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Olave’s</span> <i>Southwark</i>, is situated in
Tooley street, near the south end of
London bridge. Tho’ the time when a
church was first erected in this place cannot
be discovered, yet it appears to be of
considerable antiquity, since it is mentioned
so early as the year 1281. However, part
of the old church falling down in 1736,
and the rest being in a ruinous condition,
the parishioners applied to parliament for
a power to rebuild it, which being granted,
they were thereby enabled to raise
the sum of 5000<i>l.</i> by a rate of 6<i>d.</i> in the
pound, to be levied out of the rents of all
lands and tenements within the parish;
accordingly the church was taken down
in the summer of the year 1737, and
the present structure finished in 1739.</p>

<p class='c004'>It consists of a plain body strengthened
with rustic quoins at the corners; the door
is well proportioned without ornament,
and the windows are placed in three series;
the lowest is upright, but considerably
broad; those above them circular, and
others on the roof are large and semicircular.
The tower consists of three stages;
the uppermost of which is considerably diminished;
in this is the clock, and in the
stages below are large windows. The top of
the tower is surrounded by a plain substantial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>balustrade, and the whole has an air
of plainness and simplicity.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is a rectory in the gift of the Crown,
and the Incumbent’s profits are said to
amount to about 400<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Old Bailey</span>, a street which extends from
Ludgate hill to the top of Snow hill, by
Newgate. On the upper part near Fleet
lane, the street is divided into two by a
middle row of buildings, whence that towards
the west is called Little Old Bailey,
and the other to the eastward, is called
Great Old Bailey. This street from Ludgate
hill to Fleet lane, is in the liberties
of the Fleet. In the upper part is Justice
Hall commonly called the Sessions house,
and in the lower part Surgeons Hall.
Maitland observes, that the Old Bailey
took its name from the Bale or Bailiff’s

<p class='c011'><i>Office of</i> <span class='sc'>Ordnance</span>, in the Tower. This
office is a modern building, a little to the
north east of the white tower; and to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>officers belonging to it, all other offices
for supplying artillery, arms, ammunition,
or other warlike stores to any part of the
British dominions, are accountable; and
from this office all orders for the disposition
of warlike materials are issued. It is
therefore of very great importance, as it
has under its care the ammunition necessary
for the defence of the kingdom, and
the protection of our allies.</p>

<p class='c004'>In ancient times before the invention of
guns, this office was supplied by officers
under the following names; the Bowyer,
the Cross Bowyer, the Galeator, or Purveyor
of helmets, the Armourer, and
the Keeper of the tents; and in this state
it continued till King Henry VIII. placed
it under the management of a Master, a
Lieutenant, a Surveyor, &amp;c. as it still
continues with some improvements.</p>

<p class='c004'>The office of ordnance is now divided
into two branches, the civil and the military;
the latter being subordinate and
under the authority of the former.</p>

<p class='c004'>The principal officer in the civil
branch of the office of ordnance is the
Master General, who has a salary of
1500<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>, and is invested with
a peculiar jurisdiction over all his Majesty’s
engineers employed in the several fortifications
of this kingdom, to whom they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>are all accountable, and from whom they
receive their particular orders and instructions,
according to the directions and
commands given by his Majesty and
council.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Lieutenant General, who receives
all orders and warrants signed by the Master
General, and from the other principal
officers, and sees them duly executed;
issues orders, as the occasions of the state
may require; and gives directions for discharging
the great guns, when required
at coronations, on birth days, festivals,
signal victories, and other solemn occasions.
It is also his peculiar office to see
the train of artillery, and all its equipage
fitted for motion, when ordered to be
drawn into the field. He has a salary of
1100<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>; and under him is a
clerk in ordinary, who has 150<i>l.</i> a year;
an inferior clerk, and a clerk extraordinary,
who have each 40<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Surveyor inspects the stores and
provisions of war in the custody of the
Storekeeper, and sees that they are ranged
and placed in such order as is most proper
for their preservation. He allows all bills
of debt, and keeps a check upon all artificers
and labourers work; sees that the
stores received be good and serviceable,
duly proved, and marked, if they ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to be so, with the King’s mark, taking to
his assistance the rest of the officers and
Proof Masters. His salary is 700<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>As his post necessarily makes some assistance
necessary, he has under him the
Proof Master of England, who has 150<i>l.</i>
a year. Two clerks of the fortifications,
who have 60<i>l.</i> a year each, and another
of 40<i>l.</i> Besides, in this time of war he
has under him six extra clerks, who have
each 40<i>l.</i> a year; and another who has
4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Clerk of the ordnance records all
orders and instructions given for the government
of the office; all patents and
grants; the names of all officers, clerks,
artificers, attendants, gunners, labourers,
&amp;c. who enjoy those grants, or any other
fee for the same; draws all estimates for
provisions and supplies to be made, and
all letters, instructions, commissions, deputations,
and contracts for his Majesty’s
service; makes all bills of imprest, and
debentures, for the payment and satisfaction
for work done, and provisions received
in the said office; all quarter
books for the salaries and allowances of
all officers, clerks, &amp;c. belonging to the
office; and keeps journals and ledgers
of the receipts and returns of his Majesty’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>stores, to serve as a check between
the two accomptants of the office, the one
for money, and the other for stores. His
salary is 500<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>, and 100<i>l.</i> a
year for being a check on the Storekeeper.</p>

<p class='c004'>The great business of this officer is
managed, under him, by six clerks in
ordinary, one of whom has 180<i>l.</i> a year,
another 150<i>l.</i> two 60<i>l.</i> a year, one 50<i>l.</i> and
one 4<i>s.</i> a day: and he has at present thirteen
clerks extraordinary, who have 40<i>l.</i>
a year each. There are besides under
him a ledger keeper to the out ports, and
a home ledger keeper, who have 60<i>l.</i> a
year.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Storekeeper takes into his custody
all his Majesty’s ordnance, munitions
and stores belonging thereto, and indents
and puts them in legal security, after
they have been surveyed of by the Surveyor:
any part of which he must not deliver,
without a warrant signed by the
proper officers; nor must he receive back
any stores formerly issued, till they have
been reviewed by the Surveyor, and registered
by the Clerk of the ordnance in
the book of remains: and he must take
care that whatever is under his custody
be kept safe, and in such readiness as to
be fit for service upon the most peremptory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>command. His salary is 400<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Storekeeper has under his command
three clerks in ordinary, one of
whom has 150<i>l.</i> and another 60<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>, and also three extra clerks, each
at 40<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Clerk of the deliveries draws all orders
for delivery of any stores, and sees
them duly executed: he also charges by
indenture the particular receiver of the
stores delivered; and, in order to discharge
the Storekeeper, he registers the
copies of all warrants for the deliveries, as
well as the proportions delivered. His
salary is 400<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p class='c004'>The above officer has under him
two clerks in ordinary, one who has
150<i>l.</i> and another who has 70<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>, and also four clerks extraordinary
who have each 40<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Treasurer and Paymaster receives
and pays all monies, both salaries and debentures
in and belonging to this office.
His salary is 500<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p class='c004'>The above officer is assisted in his
double employment of receiving and paying
by three clerks in ordinary, one of
whom has 150<i>l.</i> another 60<i>l.</i> and another
50<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>, and by three clerks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>extraordinary, each of whom has 40<i>l.</i> a
year.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this office there are likewise two
Proof Masters, who have 20<i>l.</i> a year each;
a Clerk of the works, who has 120<i>l.</i> a
year; a Purveyor for the land, who has
100<i>l.</i> a year; a Purveyor for the sea, who
has 40<i>l.</i> a year; an Architect, who has
120<i>l.</i> a year; an Astronomical Observator,
who has 100<i>l.</i> a year, and some
other officers.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the other part of this office termed
the <i>Military Branch of the Ordnance</i>, is a
Chief Engineer, who has 501<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
a year; a Director, who has 365<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>; eight engineers in ordinary, who
have 10<i>s.</i> a day; eight engineers extraordinary
at 6<i>s.</i> a day; eleven sub-engineers,
at 73<i>l.</i> a year each; and sixteen pract. engineers,
at 3<i>s.</i> a day.——See an account

<p class='c011'><i>Court of</i> <span class='sc'>Orphans</span>. This court is occasionally
held at Guildhall, by the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen, who are guardians to
the children of freemen under the age
of twenty-one years at the decease of
their fathers, and take upon them not
only the management of their goods and
chattels, but likewise that of their persons,
by placing them under the care of
tutors, to prevent disposing of themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>during their minority, without their approbation.</p>

<p class='c004'>By this court the common serjeant is
authorised to take exact accounts and inventories
of all the deceased freemen’s
estates; and the youngest attorney of the
Lord Mayor’s court being clerk to that of
the orphans, is appointed to take securities
for their several portions, in the name
of the Chamberlain of London, who is a
corporation of himself, for the service of
the said orphans; and to whom a recognizance
or bond, made upon the account
of an orphan, shall by the custom
of London, descend to his successor.</p>

<p class='c004'>It may not be improper to add, that
when a freeman dies and leaves children
in their minority, the clerks of the several
parishes are according to a law of the city,
to give in their names to the common
crier, who is immediately to summon the
widow, or executor, to appear before the
court of Lord Mayor and Aldermen, to
bring an inventory of, and security for the
testator’s estate; for which two months
time is commonly allowed: and, in case
of non-appearance, or refusal of security,
the Lord Mayor may commit the contumacious
executor to Newgate. <i>Lex Lond.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Pain’s</span> <i>hill</i>, near Cobham, in Surry, is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>seat of the Honourable Charles Hamilton,
who has made great improvements,
by inclosing a large tract of barren land,
which though so poor as to produce nothing
but heath and broom, he has so well
cultivated and adorned, that few places
are equal to it. The whole place is about
five miles round; it is laid out in the
modern taste, and planted with a beautiful
variety of trees, plants, and flowers.
The fine inequalities of the ground give
a perpetual variety to the prospects, especially
on that side next the river Mole,
which river, though it lies lower than
the level of the gardens by twenty feet, is
brought into them by means of a wheel
curiously contrived, which is turned by
the river. Every time it turns round it
takes up the water and conveys it through
a spiral pipe from the circumference of
the wheel to the center of it, from whence
it is discharged into a trough, and from
thence through pipes into the gardens,
where by the joint assistance of nature and
art, it is formed into a fine winding lake
or piece of water, with an island in it,
planted and laid out in walks, with bridges
over to it of the most simple contrivance,
and the whole surrounded with rising
grounds, clumps of trees, and hanging
woods, in as romantic and picturesque a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>manner as imagination can conceive.
These gardens are but lately laid out, and
consequently some of the plantations will
appear to more advantage as they advance
in growth. But the place upon the whole
is very beautiful, and extremely well worth
seeing.</p>

the north west side of London, in the road
to Kentish town. It has a church dedicated
to St. Pancras, and called St. Pancras
in the Fields, an old plain Gothic
structure, with a square tower without a
spire. It is a vulgar tradition that this
church is of greater antiquity than that of
St. Paul’s cathedral, of which it is only a
prebend; but this arises from a mistake;
for the church of St. Pancras, termed the
mother of St. Paul’s, was situated in the
city of Canterbury, and was changed
from a Pagan temple to a Christian church
by St. Austin the monk, in the year 598,
when he dedicated it to St. Pancras.</p>

place for persons of the Romish religion.

Phrygian nobleman, who suffered martyrdom
under the Emperor Dioclesian, for
his strict adherence to the Christian religion.
This church, which was a rectory,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and one of the peculiars in this city
belonging to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
was destroyed by the fire of London,

the reign of King Stephen, and rebuilt in
the reign of Henry V. by Thomas
More, Dean of St. Paul’s, who also encompassed
it with a cloister. On the east

Walter Shiryngton, Chancellor of the
duchy of Lancaster. In this chapel were
interred several persons, whose monuments,
according to Mr. Stow, excelled in
curious workmanship those in the neighbouring
cathedral, and on the walls were
painted the Dance of Death, in imitation
of a painting in the cloister of St. Innocent’s

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Parliament.</span> This great council, which
is the highest and most ancient court of the
kingdom, was indifferently denominated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>by the Saxons, <i>Michel Gemote</i>, and <i>Witen
Gemote</i>, that is, the great court and council
of wise men. <i>Coke’s Institutes.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>The first mention we find of this court,
is on its being held in this city by Egbert
and Withlaf, Kings of Wessex, and
Mercia, in the year 833, for deliberating
on ways and means to oppose the piratical
invasions, and destructive depredations of
the Danes. <i>Spelman’s Concilia.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>This great council, which was held
twice a year before the conquest, consists
of the King, the Lords spiritual and temporal,
and the Commons: the Lords
spiritual, consisting of the two Archbishops,
and twenty-four Bishops, sit by
virtue of their respective baronies, which
they hold in a political capacity: the
Lords temporal, who are created by the
King’s patent, and therefore cannot be
reduced to any certain number, sit by descent,
or creation: and the Commons,
who amount to 558, consist of Knights,
Citizens, and Burgesses, the representatives
of the commonalty of Great Britain; who,
by virtue of the King’s writs, are elected
by the several counties, cities, and boroughs.</p>

<p class='c004'>The power of parliament is so great
and extensive, that it makes, amends, reduces,
revives, and abrogates laws, statutes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>and ordinances, concerning matters
ecclesiastical, civil, and military. None can
begin, continue, or dissolve this council,
but by the King’s authority.</p>

<p class='c004'>All the members of parliament sat together
till the fiftieth of Edward III. in
the year 1377, when the Commons
removed to the Chapter-house of Westminster,
in the cloister of the Abbey.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Paul’s</span> <i>Cathedral</i>, the most magnificent
Protestant church in the world. This
edifice has been generally supposed to have
been founded in the place where anciently
stood a temple dedicated by the Romans
to the goddess Diana; an opinion derived
from the tradition, of the heads of oxen,
the horns of deer, and the tusks of boars
having been commonly dug up there;
but as Sir Christopher Wren in clearing
the foundations of this ancient structure,
found none of these, he justly discredited
the opinion, and his son, in his <i>Parentalia</i>,
has given a different account of the origin
of the ancient edifice.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i129.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />

<p><i>S<sup>t</sup>. Paul’s</i><br /><i>S. Wale delin.</i>      <i>E. Rooker sculp.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c005'>This gentleman observes, that the first
cathedral of the episcopal see of London
was built in the area, where had been
the Roman Prætorian camp, and in the
situation on which all the succeeding
fabrics stood: but that this structure was
demolished during the great and general
persecution under the Emperor Dioclesian.
This persecution was however short, the
church is supposed to have been re-edified
under Constantine; but it was afterwards
destroyed by the Pagan Saxons, and restored
again upon the old foundations,
when they embraced Christianity in the
seventh century, when Sebert, King of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Essex, advanced Mellitus to the bishopric
of London.</p>

<p class='c004'>In 675, we find Erkenwald the fourth
Bishop of London from Mellitus, expending
great sums of money in repairing
and beautifying the ancient edifice, augmenting
its revenues, and procuring
for it the most considerable privileges
from the Pope and the Saxon princes
then reigning: for these works the Bishop
was canonized at his death, and his body
placed in a glorious shrine above the high
altar in the east part of the church, where
this shrine remained the admiration of
succeeding ages, till the fatal destruction
of the whole fabric by fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>This catastrophe happened in the year
961; and as it was rebuilt the same year,
it is highly probable, that these early
structures, how magnificent soever they
might then be thought, were only small
wooden buildings.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the Saxon heptarchy, this
church flourished extremely; Kenrad
King of Mercia declared it as free in all
its rights, as he himself desired to be at
the day of judgment; Athelstan endowed
it with fifteen lordships; Edgar, with
two; and Egleflede his wife with two
more; all which were confirmed by the
charters of Ethelred and Canute, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>solemnly imprecate curses on all who dare
to violate it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next benefactor to this church
was Edward the Confessor; but at the
Norman invasion, which soon followed,
some of its revenues were seized by the
Conqueror; but he was no sooner seated
on the throne, than he caused full restitution
to be made; and even confirmed
all its rights, privileges and immunities,
in the amplest manner; with benedictions
upon those who should augment its possessions,
and solemn imprecations upon
all who should violate any of the charters
made in its favour.</p>

<p class='c004'>In that reign, however, a dreadful fire
consumed it a second time, and by this
conflagration, which happened in 1086,
the greatest part of this city was also laid
in ashes: but this destruction served to
make way for a more magnificent building,
than had ever yet been applied to the
purposes of devotion in this kingdom.
Maurice, then Bishop of London, having
undertaken this great work, obtained of
the King the old stones of a spacious
castle in the neighbourhood called the
Palatine Tower, situated near the river
Fleet; but though he lived twenty years,
and prosecuted the work with uncommon
earnestness, yet he left the completion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>of what he had begun to succeeding
generations.</p>

<p class='c004'>The successor of this Bishop followed
his example, and even applied the whole
revenue of his see towards the advancement
of this great work; but like the
former left it unfinished; after which it
is supposed to have been compleated by
lay persons; but at what time, or in what
manner, is no where mentioned. Indeed
William Rufus, who succeeded the Conqueror,
is said to have exempted all ships
entering the river Fleet with stone or
other materials for the new cathedral,
from toll and custom; and it is not improbable
that he might take this structure
under his own particular direction.</p>

<p class='c004'>But notwithstanding the length of time,
and the great expence bestowed upon this
church, it had not long been compleated,
when it was thought not sufficiently magnificent;
the steeple was therefore rebuilt
and finished about the year 1221; and then
Roger Niger being promoted to the see of
London in 1229, proceeding with the
choir compleated it in 1240, and solemnly
consecrated it afresh the same year, in
the presence of the King, the Pope’s Legate,
and many Lords both spiritual and
temporal.</p>

<p class='c004'>The spacious and magnificent edifice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>of St. Paul’s cathedral, being thus finished,
a survey was taken of it, by which
its dimensions appear to have been as
follows. The length of the body of the
church was 690 feet; the breadth
130; the height of the roof of the west
part within 102 feet; that of the east
88; and that of the body 150; the
height of the tower from the ground was
260 feet; from whence rose a wooden
spire covered with lead 274 feet in length;
on the top of which was a ball nine feet
one inch in circumference. This was
crowned with a cross that was fifteen
feet in length, and the traverse six feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ornaments of this cathedral exceeded
those of every other church in the
kingdom. The high altar stood between
two columns, adorned with precious
stones, and surrounded with images most
beautifully wrought, and covered with a
canopy of wood curiously painted with
the representation of Saints and Angels.</p>

<p class='c004'>The new shrine of St. Erkenwald
stood on the east side of the wall above the
high altar, and was adorned with gold,
silver, and precious stones; but not being
thought sufficiently rich, in 1339 three
goldsmiths of London were retained by
the Dean and Chapter to work upon it a
whole year, at the end of which its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>lustre was so great, that Princes, Nobles,
Ambassadors, and other foreigners of rank
flocked from all parts to visit it, and to
offer their oblations before it: among
these we find all the rings and jewels of
Walter de Thorp, and the best saphire
stone of Richard de Preston; which last
was applied to the curing of infirmities
of the eyes, and proclamation of its virtues
was made by the express will of the
donor.</p>

<p class='c004'>The picture of St. Paul finely painted,
was placed in a wooden tabernacle on the
right side of the high altar, and was
esteemed a masterly performance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Against a pillar in the body of the
church, stood a beautiful image of the
Virgin Mary; and that a lamp might be
continually kept burning before it, and
an anthem sung every day, John Burnet,
Bishop of Bath and Wells, bequeathed a
handsome estate.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the center stood a large cross, and
towards the north door a crucifix at which
offerings were made, that greatly increased
the revenue of the Dean and Canons.</p>

<p class='c004'>The last piece of ornament we shall
mention, was the fine dial belonging to
the great clock, which being visible to all
who passed by, care was taken that it
should appear with the utmost splendor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>and in particular an angel pointed to the
hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under this cathedral was a parish
church called St. Faith’s, in which several
persons of distinction were formerly interred:
but no records remain that mention
the time when divine worship was performed
in it.</p>

<p class='c004'>St. Paul’s cathedral was encompassed
with a wall about the year 1109, which
extended from the north east corner of
Ave Mary lane, eastward along Pater
noster row, to the north end of the Old
Change in Cheapside; whence it ran
southward to Carter lane, and passing on
the north side of it to Creed lane, turned
up to Ludgate street. To this wall there
were six gates, the principal of which was
situated near the end of Creed lane in
Ludgate street. The second was at St.
Paul’s alley in Pater noster row, the third
at Canon alley; the fourth, called the
Little gate, was situated at the entrance
into Cheapside; the fifth, called St. Austin’s,
led to Watling street; and the sixth
fronted the south gate of the church near
St. Paul’s chain.</p>

<p class='c004'>Within the north side of this enclosure
was situated in the middle of the church
yard, a pulpit cross, at which sermons
were preached weekly; and here was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>held the folkmote, or general convention
of the citizens.</p>

<p class='c004'>Facing this cross stood the charnel, in
which the bones of the dead were decently
piled up together, a thousand loads
whereof were removed to Finsbury fields
in the reign of Edward VI. and there laid
in a moorish place, with so much earth
to cover them, as raised a considerable
mount, on which was erected three windmills
to stand upon.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the north west corner of the church
yard, was the episcopal palace, contiguous
to which on the east was a cemetery denominated
Pardon Church Haw, where
Gilbert Becket erected a chapel in the
reign of King Stephen. See <span class='sc'>Pardon
Church</span>.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the east of the church yard was a
clochier or bell tower by St. Paul’s school;
wherein were four great bells, called
Jesus bells, from their belonging to Jesus
chapel in St. Faith’s church; but these,
together with a fine image of St. Paul on
the top of the spire, being won by Sir
Miles Partridge, Knt. of Henry VIII. at
one cast of the dice, were by that gentleman
taken down and sold.</p>

<p class='c004'>It may not be improper here to take
notice of the celebration of divine service,
the obsequies, anniversaries and chauntries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>particularly belonging to this cathedral:
as to the first, Richard Clifford, Bishop
of London, in 1414, with the consent
of the Dean and Chapter, ordained that
from thence forward it should be altered
from the old form, and made conformable
to the church of Salisbury, and
other cathedrals within this kingdom.</p>

<p class='c004'>The performance of obsequies for great
persons deceased, was however retained
as a peculiar privilege of this cathedral,
from whence great profits arose. Indeed
“the state and order observed on these
occasions,” says Sir William Dugdale,
“was little inferior to that used at the
funerals of those great personages; the
church and choir being hung with black,
and escutcheons of their arms; their
herses set up in wonderful magnificence,
adorned with rich banner rolls, &amp;c. and
environed with barriers; having chief
mourners and assistants, accompanied by
several Bishops and Abbots in their proper
habits; the Ambassadors of foreign
Princes, many of our Nobility, the
Knights of the Garter, the Lord Mayor,
and the several Companies of London,
who all attended with great devotion at
these ceremonies.”  This author adds
a list of Emperors, Empresses, and Kings
performed in this cathedral.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>As to anniversaries, those of the conversion
and commemoration of St. Paul,
the consecration of the church, and the
canonization of St. Erkenwald, were the
principal. It is very remarkable, with
respect to the first of these anniversaries,
that Sir William le Baud, Knt. in the
third year of Edward I. granted a good
fat doe annually on the day of the conversion
of St. Paul, and a good fat buck
upon the day of commemoration, which
till the reign of Queen Elizabeth were received
with great formality at the steps
of the choir, by the Canons cloathed in
their sacred vestments, with garlands of
flowers on their heads. Camden, who
was an eye witness of this solemnity, says,
that the horns of the buck were carried on
a spear in procession round the inside of
the church, the men blowing horns, &amp;c.
and then the buck being offered at the high
altar, a shilling was ordered by the Dean
and Chapter for the entertainment of the
servants who brought it, and this concluded
the ceremony.</p>

<p class='c004'>The anniversaries of the consecration
and canonization, were celebrated at the
public expence: but there were other
anniversaries of a private nature, provided
for by particular endowments, as that of
Sir John Poultney, Knt. who had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>four times Lord Mayor of London, and
assigned annual salaries to all who bore
office about the church, together with
an allowance of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to the Lord
Mayor, 5<i>s.</i> to the Recorder; 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to
the two Sheriffs; 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to the Common
Crier; 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to the Lord Mayor’s serjeants,
and 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to the Master of the
college of St. Laurence Poultney, provided
they were present at his anniversary;
but if any were absent, their share
were to be distributed to the poor. There
were many other anniversaries of the same
kind.</p>

<p class='c004'>The chauntries founded by men of
condition for the maintenance of one or
two priests, to celebrate divine service
daily, for the release from purgatory of
their souls, the souls of their dearest friends
and relations, and of all the faithful
deceased; but these were in a short time
increased to such a degree, and the endowments
were so slender, that so early
as the reign of Richard II. Bishop Baybroke
caused forty-four of them to be
united into one solemn service.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having thus taken a transient survey of
this magnificent edifice, in its flourishing
state, with all its appendages, we shall now
view its decline, and trace this venerable
Gothic structure to its final destruction.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>The first remarkable misfortune that
befel it was in 1444, when about two
o’clock in the afternoon, its lofty wooden
spire was fired by lightning; but by the
assiduity of the citizens, it was soon
seemingly extinguished: however to their
great surprise and terror it broke out again
with redoubled fury at about nine
o’clock at night; but by the indefatigable
pains of the Lord Mayor and citizens, it
was at last effectually extinguished. The
damage was not however fully repaired
till the year 1462, when the spire was
compleated, and a beautiful fane of gilt
copper in the form of an eagle was
placed upon it.</p>

<p class='c004'>About an hundred years after this accident,
another of the same kind happened
to it, generally attributed to the same
cause, but much more fatal in its consequences;
the fire consuming not only
the fine spire, but the upper roof of the
church, and that of the aisles for in the
space of four hours it burnt all the rafters,
and every thing else that was combustible:
but though it was universally believed that
this fire was occasioned by lightning, yet,
Dr. Heylin says, that an ancient plumber
confessed at his death, that it was occasioned
through his negligence in carelessly
leaving a pan of coals in the steeple, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>he went to dinner, which taking hold
of the dry timber in the spire, was got to
such a height at his return, that he judged
it impossible to quench it, and therefore
concluded it would be more consistent
with his safety, not to contradict the
common report.</p>

<p class='c004'>This calamity was followed by a general
contribution among the clergy, nobility,
great officers of state, the city of
London, and the Queen herself, who
gave a thousand marks in gold towards its
speedy repair, with a warrant for a thousand
loads of timber to be cut in any of
her woods, wherever it should be found
most convenient; so that in five years
time, the timber roofs were entirely
finished, and covered with lead, the two
largest being framed in Yorkshire, and
brought by sea; but some difference in
opinion arising about the model of the
steeple, that part of the work was left
unattempted; and it was never after rebuilt;
for upon raising the roofs the
walls were found to be so much damaged
by the fire, that it was judged necessary
to make a general repair of the whole
building; but this was deferred for a long
time.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length Mr. Henry Farley, after
above eight years earnest solicitation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>King James I. prevailed on his Majesty to
interpose in order to prevent the ruin of
this venerable fabric, when that Prince,
considering of what importance appearances
are in the promotion of public
zeal, caused it to be rumoured abroad,
that on Sunday the 26th of March 1620,
he would be present at divine service in St.
Paul’s cathedral.</p>

<p class='c004'>Accordingly at the day appointed, his
Majesty came thither on horseback in all
the pomp of royalty, attended by the
principal nobility and great officers of his
court, and was met by the Lord Mayor,
Aldermen and Livery in their formalities,
who, upon the King’s alighting at the
great west door, joined in the procession.
When his Majesty entered the church, he
kneeled near the brazen pillar, where he
prayed for success; and then was received
under a canopy, supported by the Dean
and Residentiaries, the rest of the Prebends
and Dignitaries, with the whole
company of singing men advancing before
him to the choir, which, on this occasion,
was richly adorned with hangings.
Here he heard an anthem, and then proceeded
to the cross, where Dr. King,
Bishop of London, preached a sermon
suitable to the occasion, from a text given
him by his Majesty, in Psalm cii. 13, 14.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>and this sermon was afterwards circulated
with considerable effect through the whole
kingdom. After divine service was ended,
his Majesty and the whole court were
splendidly entertained at the Bishop’s
palace, where a consultation was held, in
which it was agreed to issue a commission
under the great seal, directed to the principal
personages in the kingdom, empowering
them to consider of the necessary
repairs, and to raise money for carrying
them into execution. But tho’ the
commissioners afterwards met to prosecute
this enquiry, yet, as it was found that
the ruin of the Bishop and principal Dignitaries
of the cathedral was chiefly
aimed at, the whole affair came to nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, in the succeeding reign
another commission was obtained for
the same purpose, by the assiduity of
Archbishop Laud, which was attended
with better success; so that in 1632,
Inigo Jones, his Majesty’s Surveyor-general,
was ordered to begin there pairs
at the south east end, and to bring them
along by the south to the west end.</p>

<p class='c004'>That celebrated architect prosecuted the
work with such diligence, that in nine
years time, the whole was finished both
within and without, except the steeple,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>which was intended to be entirely taken
down, and a magnificent portico of the
Corinthian order, was also erected at
the west end, at the sole expence of
King Charles I. ornamented with the
statues of his royal father and himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Every thing being now in readiness for
erecting the steeple and spire, which were
to be of stone, an estimate was made of
the money contributed, and that already
expended in repairs; whereby it appeared
that 101,330<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> had been received
into the chamber of London on this account,
and but 35,551<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> paid out,
so that there appeared to be a fund in hand
sufficient to erect it in the most magnificent
manner: but the flames of civil war
soon after breaking out, a period was put
to this great design.</p>

<p class='c004'>The revenues were now seized, the
famous Pulpit Cross in the church yard
was pulled down; the scaffolding of the
steeple was assigned by parliament for the
payment of arrears due to the army; the
body of the church was converted into
saw pits; part of the south cross was
suffered to tumble down; the west part of
the church was converted into a stable; and
the stately new portico into shops for milliners
and others, with lodging rooms over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>them, at the erecting of which, Dr. Heylin
observes, the magnificent columns were
piteously mangled, being obliged to make
way for the ends of beams, which penetrated
their centers.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, at the restoration, a new
commission was procured for its immediate
reparation, and great sums of money
raised by a voluntary contribution; but
before any thing material could be accomplished,
the dreadful fire of London
reduced the whole edifice to little better
than a heap of ruins.</p>

<p class='c004'>After two years fruitless labour in endeavouring
to fit up some part of the
old fabric for divine worship, it was found
to be incapable of any substantial repair.
It was therefore resolved to raze the foundations
of the old building, and to erect
on the same spot a new cathedral
that should equal, if not exceed the
splendor of the old; for this end letters
patent were granted to several Lords spiritual
and temporal, authorising them to
proceed in the work, and appointing Dr.
Christopher Wren, Surveyor-general of
all his Majesty’s works, to prepare a model.
Contributions came in so extremely fast,
that in the first ten years above 126,000<i>l.</i>
was paid into the chamber of London; a
new duty for the carrying on of this work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>was laid on coals, which at a medium
produced 5000<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>, and his
Majesty generously contributed 1000<i>l.</i>
a year, towards carrying on the work.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dr. Wren, afterwards Sir Christopher,
was now called upon to produce his designs;
he had before drawn several, in order
to discover what would be most acceptable
to the general taste; and finding
that persons of all degrees declared for
magnificence and grandeur, he formed a
very noble one, conformable to the best
style of the Greek and Roman architecture,
and having caused a large model to
be made of it in wood, with all its ornaments,
he presented it to his Majesty; but
the Bishops not approving of it, as not
enough of a cathedral fashion, the Surveyor
was ordered to amend it, upon
which he produced the scheme of the
present structure, which was honoured
with his Majesty’s approbation. The first
design, however, which was only of the
Corinthian order, like St. Peter’s at Rome,
the Surveyor set a higher value upon than on
any other he ever drew, and as the author
of his life observes, would have put it in
execution with more cheerfulness, than
that which we now see erected. This
curious model is still preserved in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>cathedral, and may be seen at a small
expence.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the year 1675, Dr. Wren began
to prosecute the work; the pulling
down the old walls, which were eighty
feet high, and clearing the rubbish, had
cost many of the labourers their lives;
and this put him upon contriving to facilitate
its execution by art. The first project
he tried was with gunpowder; for
on their coming to the tower of the
steeple, the men absolutely refused to work
upon it; for its height struck the most
hardy of them with terror. He therefore
caused a hole of about four feet wide to be
dug in the foundation of the north west
pillar, it being supported by four pillars
each fourteen feet diameter, and then
with tools made on purpose, wrought a
hole two feet square into the center of the
pillar, in which he placed a little deal
box, containing only eighteen pounds of
powder. A cane was fixed to the box with
a match, and the hole closed up again
with as much strength as possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nothing now remained but to set fire
to the train, and the Surveyor was exceeding
curious to observe the effect of
the explosion, which indeed was wonderful;
for this small quantity of powder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>not only lifted up the whole angle of the
tower, with two arches that rested upon
it; but also the two adjoining arches of
the isles, and all above them; and this
it seemed to do somewhat leisurely, cracking
the walls to the top, and lifting up
visibly the whole weight about nine inches,
which suddenly tumbling to its center,
again caused an enormous heap of ruin,
without scattering, and it was half a
minute before this huge mountain opened
in two or three places and emitted smoke.
The shock of so great a weight from a
height of two hundred feet, alarmed the
inhabitants round about with the terrible
apprehensions of an earthquake.</p>

<p class='c004'>A second trial of the same kind, was
made by a person appointed by Dr. Wren,
who being too wise in his own conceit,
disobeyed the orders he had received, put
in a greater quantity of powder, and
omitted to take the same care in closing
up the hole, or digging to the foundation;
but though this second trial had the desired
effect, yet one stone was shot as from
the mouth of a cannon to the opposite
side of the church yard, and entered a
private room where some women were at
work; but no other damage was done,
besides spreading a panic among the
neighbours, who instantly made application
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>above against the farther use of
gunpowder, and orders were issued from
the council board accordingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Surveyor being now reduced to the
necessity of making new experiments, resolved
to try the battering ram of the ancients,
and therefore caused a strong mast
forty feet long to be shod with iron at the
biggest end, and fortified every way with
bars and ferrels, and having caused it to
be suspended set it to work. Thirty men
were employed in vibrating this machine,
who beat in one place against the wall a
whole day without any visible effect. He
however bid them not despair, but try
what another day would produce; and
on the second day the wall was perceived
to tremble at the top, and in a few hours
it fell to the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>In clearing the foundation, he found
that the north side had been anciently a
great burying place; for under the graves
of these latter ages, he found in a row the
graves of the Saxons, who cased their
dead in chalk stones; tho’ persons of great
eminence were buried in stone coffins:
below these were the graves of the ancient
Britons, as was manifest from the great
number of ivory and wooden pins found
among the mouldered dust; for it was
their method only to pin the corpse in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>woollen shrouds, and lay them in the
ground, and this covering being consumed,
the ivory and wooden pins remained
entire.</p>

<p class='c004'>At a still greater depth he discovered a
great number of Roman potsheards, urns,
and dishes, sound, and of a beautiful red
like our sealing wax; on the bottoms of
some of them were inscriptions, which
denoted their having been drinking vessels;
and on others, which resembled our
modern sallad dishes, beautifully made
and curiously wrought, was the inscription
DZ. PRIMANI. and on others,
those of PATRICI. QUINTIMANI.
VICTOR. IANUS. RECINIO, &amp;c. The
pots and several glass vessels were of a
murrey colour; and others resembling
urns, were beautifully embellished on the
outsides with raised work, representing
grey hounds, stags, hares, and rose trees.
Others were of a cinnamon colour, in
the form of an urn, and tho’ a little faded,
appeared as if they had been gilt. Some
resembling juggs formed an hexagon, and
were curiously indented and adorned with
a variety of figures in basso relievo.</p>

<p class='c004'>The red vessels appeared to have been
the most honourable; for on them were
inscribed the names of their deities,
heroes, and judges; and the matter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>which these vessels were made, was of
such an excellent composition, as to vie
with polished metal in beauty.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were also discovered several
brass coins, which by their long continuance
in the earth were become a prey to
time; but some of them that were in a
more favourable soil, were so well preserved
as to discover in whose reign they
were coined: on one of them was
Adrian’s head, with a galley under oars
on the reverse; and on others, the heads
of Romulus and Remus, Claudius and
Constantine.</p>

<p class='c004'>At a somewhat smaller depth were discovered
a number of <i>lapilli</i> or <i>tesselæ</i>, of
various sorts of marble, viz. Egyptian,
Porphyry, Jasper, &amp;c. in the form of dice,
which were used by the Romans in paving
the <i>prætorium</i>, or General’s tent. <i>Conyers
M. S. in the Sloanian library, in the
Museum.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>On searching for the natural ground,
Dr. Wren perceived that the foundation
of the old church stood upon a layer
of very close and hard pot earth, on the
north side about six feet deep, but gradually
thinning towards the south, till on
the declivity of the hill, it was scarce
four feet; yet he concluded that the
same ground which had borne so weighty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>a building before, might reasonably be
trusted again. However, boring beneath
this, he found a stratum of loose sand;
and lower still, at low water mark, water
and sand mixed with periwinkles and
other sea shells; under this, a hard
beach; and below all the natural bed of
clay that extends far and wide, under the
city, country, and river.</p>

<p class='c004'>The foundations appeared to be those
originally laid, consisting of Kentish
rubble stone, artfully worked and consolidated
with exceeding hard mortar,
after the Roman manner, much excelling
what he found in the superstructure. What
induced him to change the scite of the
church, and eraze the old foundations
which were so firm, was the desire of
giving the new structure a more free and
graceful aspect; yet after all, he found
himself too much confined; and unable
to bring his front to lie exactly from
Ludgate. However, in his progress he
met with one misfortune that made him
almost repent of the alteration he had
made; he began the foundation from the
west to the east, and then extending his
line to the north east, where he expected
no interruption, he fell upon a pit, where
the hard crust of pot earth, already mentioned,
had been taken away, and to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>unspeakable mortification, filled up with
rubbish: he wanted but six or seven feet
to complete his design, yet there was no
other remedy but digging thro’ the sand,
and building from the solid earth, that
was at least forty feet deep. He therefore
sunk a pit eighteen feet wide, tho’
he wanted at most but seven, thro’ all the
strata, that has been already mentioned,
and laid the foundations of a square pier
of solid good masonry, which he carried up
till he came within fifteen feet of the present
surface; and then turned a short arch
under ground to the level of the stratum
of hard pot-earth, upon which arch the
north east coin of the choir now stands.</p>

<p class='c004'>This difficulty being surmounted, and
the foundations laid, he for several reasons
made choice of Portland stone for the
superstructure; but chiefly as the largest
scantlings were to be procured from
thence: however, as these could not be
depended upon for columns exceeding four
feet in diameter, this determined this
great architect to make choice of two orders
instead of one, and an Attic story,
as at St. Peter’s at Rome, in order to preserve
the just proportions of his cornice,
otherwise the edifice must have fallen short
of its intended height. Bramante in
building St. Peter’s, though he had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>quarries of Tivoli at hand, where he
could have blocks large enough for his
columns of nine feet diameter, yet for
want of stones of suitable dimensions, was
obliged to diminish the proportions of the
proper members of his cornice; a fault
against which Dr. Wren resolved to
guard. On these principles he therefore
proceeded, in raising the present magnificent
edifice.</p>

<p class='c004'>The general form of St. Paul’s cathedral
is a long cross: the walls are wrought in
rustic, and strengthened as well as adorned
by two rows of coupled pilasters, one over
the other; the lower Corinthian, and
the upper Composite. The spaces between
the arches of the windows, and the
architrave of the lower order, are filled
with a great variety of curious enrichments,
as are those above.</p>

<p class='c004'>The west front is graced with a most
magnificent portico, a noble pediment,
and two stately turrets, and when one
advances towards the church from Ludgate,
the elegant construction of this front,
the fine turrets over each corner, and the
vast dome behind, fill the mind with a
pleasing astonishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this end, there is a noble flight of
steps of black marble, that extend the
whole length of the portico, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>consists of twelve lofty Corinthian columns
below, and eight of the Composite order
above; these are all coupled and fluted.
The upper series supports a noble pediment
crowned with its acroteria. In this
pediment is a very elegant representation
in bas relief, of the conversion of St. Paul,
which was executed by Mr. Bird, an artist,
who, by this piece, has deserved to
have his name transmitted to posterity.
Nothing could have been conceived more
difficult to represent in bas relief than this
conversion; the most striking object being
naturally the irradiation of light, but
even this is well expressed, and the figures
are excellently performed. The magnificent
figure of St. Paul, also on the apex
of the pediment, with St. Peter on his
right and St. James on his left, have a fine
effect. The four Evangelists with their
proper emblems on the front of the
towers, are also very judiciously disposed,
and well executed: St. Matthew is distinguished
by an angel: St. Mark, by a
lion; St. Luke, by an ox; and St. John,
by an eagle.</p>

<p class='c004'>To the north portico, there is an ascent
by twelve circular steps of black marble;
and its dome is supported by six large
Corinthian columns, forty-eight inches
in diameter. Upon the dome is a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and well proportioned urn, finely ornamented
with festoons; and over this is
a pediment supported by pilasters in the
wall, in the face of which is the royal
arms, with the regalia, supported by
angels. And lest this view of the cathedral
should appear void of sufficient ornament,
the statues of five of the Apostles
are placed on the top at proper distances.</p>

<p class='c004'>The south portico answers to the north,
and is placed directly opposite to it. This,
like the other, is a dome supported by six
noble Corinthian columns: but, as the
ground is considerably lower on this, than
on the other side of the church, the ascent
is by a flight of twenty-five steps. This
portico has also a pediment above, in
which is a phœnix rising out of the flames
with the motto RESURGAM underneath
it, as an emblem of the rebuilding
the church after the fire. This device had
perhaps its origin from an incident, which
happened at the beginning of the work,
and was particularly remarked by the
architect as a favourable omen. When
Dr. Wren himself had set out upon the
place the dimensions of the building, and
fixed upon the center of the great dome,
a common labourer was ordered to bring
him a flat stone, the first he found among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the rubbish, to leave as a mark of direction
to the masons; the stone which the
fellow brought for this purpose, happened
to be a piece of a grave stone with nothing
remaining of the inscription but this
single word in large capitals, RESURGAM;
a circumstance which Dr. Wren
never forgot. On this side of the building
are likewise five statues, which take their
situation from that of St. Andrew on
the apex of the last mentioned pediment.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the cast end of the church is a sweep
or circular projection for the altar, finely
ornamented with the orders, and with
sculpture, particularly a noble piece in
honour of his Majesty King William III.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dome which rises in the center of
the whole, appears extremely grand.
Twenty feet above the roof of the church
is a circular range of thirty-two columns,
with niches placed exactly against others
within. These are terminated by their
entablature, which supports a handsome
gallery adorned with a balustrade. Above
these columns is a range of pilasters, with
windows between; and from the entablature
of these the diameter decreases
very considerably; and two feet above
that it is again contracted. From this
part the external sweep of the dome begins,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>and the arches meet at fifty-two
feet above. On the summit of the dome
is an elegant balcony; and from its center
rises the lanthorn adorned with Corinthian
columns; and the whole is terminated by
a ball, from which rises a cross, both elegantly
gilt. These parts, which appear
from below of a very moderate size, are
extremely large.</p>

<p class='c004'>This vast and noble fabric, which is
2292 feet in circumference, and 340 feet
in height to the top of the cross, is surrounded
at a proper distance by a dwarf
stone wall, on which is placed the most
magnificent balustrade of cast iron perhaps
in the universe, of about five feet six inches
in height, exclusive of the wall. In this
stately enclosure are seven beautiful iron
gates, which, together with the banisters,
in number about 2500, weigh two
hundred tons and eighty-one pounds,
which having cost 6<i>d.</i> per pound, the
whole, with other charges, amounted to
11,202<i>l.</i> and 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>In the area of the grand west front, on a
pedestal of excellent workmanship, stands
a statue of Queen Anne, formed of
white marble with proper decorations. The
figures on the base represent Britannia with
her spear; Gallia, with a crown in her lap;
Hibernia, with her harp; and America
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>with her bow. These, and the colossal
statues with which the church is adorned,
were all done by the ingenious Mr. Hill,
who was chiefly employed in the decorations.</p>

<p class='c004'>The north east part of the church yard
is conferred by the Dean and Chapter
upon the inhabitants of St. Faith’s parish,
which is united to St. Austin’s, for the
interment of their dead; as is also the
south east part of the cemetery, with a vault
therein, granted to St. Gregory’s parish for
the same use.</p>

<p class='c004'>On ascending the steps at the west end,
we find three doors ornamented on the top
with bas relief; the middle door, which is
by far the largest, is cased with white
marble, and over it is a fine piece of basso
relievo, in which St. Paul is represented
preaching to the Bereans. On entering
this door, on the inside of which hang the
colours taken from the French at Louisbourg
in 1758, the mind is struck by the
nobleness of the vista; an arcade supported
by lofty and massy pillars on each
hand, divide the church into the body
and two isles, and the view is terminated
by the altar at the extremity of the choir.
The above pillars are adorned with columns
and pilasters of the Corinthian and
Composite orders, and the arches of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>roof enriched with shields, festoons, chaplets
and other ornaments.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the isle on one hand is the consistory,
and opposite to it on the other is the
morning prayer chapel, where divine service
is performed every morning early,
Sunday excepted: each of these have a
very beautiful screen of carved wainscot,
that is admired by the best judges, and
each are adorned with twelve columns,
arched pediments and the royal arms,
finely decorated.</p>

<p class='c004'>On proceeding forward, you come to
the large cross isle between the north and
south porticos; over which is the cupola.
Here you have a view of the whispering
gallery, of the paintings above it, and the
concave, which fills the mind with surprise
and pleasure. Under its center is
fixed in the floor a brass plate, round
which the pavement is beautifully variegated;
but the figures into which it is
formed can no where be so well seen as
from the whispering gallery.</p>

<p class='c004'>You have now a full view of the organ,
richly ornamented with carved work,
with the entrance to the choir directly
under it. The two isles on the sides of
the choir, as well as the choir itself, are here
enclosed with very fine iron rails and gates.</p>

<p class='c004'>The organ gallery is supported by eight
Corinthian columns of blue and white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>marble, and the choir has on each side
thirty stalls, besides the Bishop’s throne
on the south side, and the Lord Mayor’s
on the north. The carving of the beautiful
range of stalls as well as that of the organ,
is much admired.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here the reader’s desk, which is at some
distance from the pulpit, is an enclosure
of very fine brass rails gilt, in which is a
gilt brass pillar supporting an eagle of brass
gilt, which holds the book on his back and
expanded wings.</p>

<p class='c004'>The altar piece is adorned with four
noble fluted pilasters painted and veined
with gold in imitation of lapis lazuli, and
their capitals are double gilt. In the intercolumniations
are twenty-one pannels
of figured crimson velvet, and above them
six windows, in two series.</p>

<p class='c004'>The floor of the choir, and indeed of the
whole church, is paved with marble: but
within the rails of the altar with porphyry,
polished and laid in several geometrical
figures.</p>

<p class='c004'>But to be more particular: as the disposition
of the vaultings within is an essential
beauty, without which many other
ornaments would lose their effect, so the
architect was particularly careful in this
respect. “The Romans,” says the author
of the <i>Parentalia</i>,  “used hemispherical
vaultings, and Sir Christopher chose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>those as being demonstrably lighter than
the diagonal cross vaults: so the whole
vault of St. Paul’s consists of twenty-four
cupolas cut off semicircular, with
segments to join to the great arches one
way, and which are cut across the
other, with eliptical cylinders to let in
the upper lights of the nave; but in
the isles the lesser cupolas are both
ways cut in semicircular sections, and
altogether make a graceful geometrical
form, distinguished with circular
wreaths which is the horizontal section
of the cupola; for the hemisphere may
be cut all manner of ways into circular
sections; and the arches and wreaths
being of stone carved, the spandrels
between are of sound brick, invested
with stucco of cockle-shell lime, which
becomes as hard as Portland stone; and
which having large planes between the
stone ribs, are capable of the farther
ornaments of painting, if required.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Besides these twenty-four cupolas,
there is a half cupola at the east, and
the great cupola of 108 feet in diameter
at the middle of the crossing of the great
isles. In this the architect imitated the
Pantheon at Rome, excepting that the
upper order is there only umbratile,
and distinguished by different coloured
marbles; in St. Paul’s it is extant out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>of the wall. The Pantheon is no higher
within than its diameter; St. Peter’s is
two diameters; this shews too high,
the other too low; St. Paul’s is a mean
proportion between both, which shews
its concave every way, and is very
lightsome by the windows of the upper
order, which strike down the light
thro’ the great colonade that encircles
the dome without, and serves for the
abutment of the dome, which is brick
of two bricks thick; but as it rises
every way five feet high, has a course
of excellent brick of eighteen inches
long banding thro’ the whole thickness;
and moreover, to make it still
more secure, it is surrounded with a
vast chain of iron strongly linked together
at every ten feet. This chain
is let into a channel cut into the bandage
of Portland stone, and defended
from the weather by filling the groove
with lead.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The concave was turned upon a
center; which was judged necessary
to keep the work even and true, though
a cupola might be built without a center;
but it is observable that the center
was laid without any standards from
below to support; and as it was both
centering and scaffolding, it remained
for the use of the painter. Every story
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>of this scaffolding being circular, and
the ends of all the ledgers meeting as
so many rings, and truly wrought, it
supported itself. This machine was
an original of the kind, and will be an
useful project for the like work, to an
architect hereafter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was necessary to give a greater
height than the cupola would gracefully
allow within, tho’ it is considerably
above the roof of the church; yet the
old church having before had a very
lofty spire of timber and lead, the
world expected that the new work
should not, in this respect, fall short of
the old; the architect was therefore
obliged to comply with the humour of
the age, and to raise another structure
over the first cupola; and this was a
cone of brick, so built as to support a
stone lanthorn of an elegant figure,
and ending in ornaments of copper gilt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“As the whole church above the
vaulting is covered with a substantial
oaken roof, and lead, the most durable
covering in our climate, so he covered
and hid out of sight the brick cone,
with another cupola of timber and
lead; and between this and the cone,
are easy stairs that ascend to the lanthorn.
Here the spectator may have a
view of such amazing contrivances as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>are indeed astonishing. He forbore to
make little luthern windows in the
leaden cupola, as are done out of St.
Peter’s, because he had otherwise provided
for light enough to the stairs
from the lanthorn above, and round
the pedestal of the same, which are
now seen below; so that he only ribbed
the outward cupola, which he
thought less Gothic than to stick it full
of such little lights in three stories one
above another, as is the cupola of St.
Peter’s, which could not without difficulty
be mended, and, if neglected,
would soon damage the timbers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As Sir Christopher was sensible, that
paintings, tho’ ever so excellent, are liable
to decay, he intended to have beautified
the inside of the cupola with mosaic work,
which strikes the eye of the beholder
with amazing lustre, and without the least
decay of colours, is as durable as the
building itself; but in this he was unhappily
over-ruled, tho’ he had undertaken to
procure four of the most eminent artists in
that profession from Italy; this part is
however richly decorated and painted by
Sir James Thornhill, who has represented
the principal passages of St. Paul’s life in
eight compartments, viz. his conversion;
his punishing Elymas, the sorcerer, with
blindness; his preaching at Athens; his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>curing the poor cripple at Lystra, and the
reverence paid him there by the priests
of Jupiter as a God; his conversion of the
jailer; his preaching at Ephesus, and the
burning of the magic books in consequence
of the miracles he wrought there;
his trial before Agrippa; his shipwreck on
the island of Melita, or Malta, with the
miracle of the viper. These paintings
are all seen to advantage by means of a
circular opening, through which the light
is transmitted with admirable effect from
the lanthorn above.</p>

<p class='c004'>The highest or last stone on the top of
the lanthorn, was laid by Mr. Christopher
Wren, the son of this great architect, in
the year 1710; and thus was this noble
fabric, lofty enough to be discerned at sea
eastward, and at Windsor to the west,
begun and compleated in the space of
thirty-five years, by one architect, the
great Sir Christopher Wren; one principal
mason, Mr. Strong; and under one
Bishop of London, Dr. Henry Compton:
whereas St. Peter’s at Rome, the only
structure that can come in competition
with it, continued an hundred and fifty
five years in building, under twelve successive
architects; assisted by the police
and interests of the Roman see; attended
by the best artists of the world in sculpture,
statuary, painting and mosaic work;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>and facilitated by the ready acquisition of
marble from the neighbouring quarries of
Tivoli.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>The curiosities in this cathedral which
strangers pay for seeing.</i> On entering
the south door, there is a pair of stairs
within a small door on the right, leading
to the cupola, and the stranger by paying
two pence may gratify his curiosity with
a prospect from the iron gallery at the
foot of the lanthorn, which in a clear day
affords a fine view of the river, of this
whole metropolis and all the adjacent
country, interspersed with pleasant villages.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ascent to this gallery is by 534
steps, 260 of which are so easy that a
child may without difficulty ascend them;
but those above are unpleasant, and in some
places very dark; but the little light
that is afforded is sufficient to shew amazing
proofs of the wonderful contrivances
of the architect. But as the first gallery,
surrounded by a stone balustrade, affords
a very fine prospect, many are satisfied,
and unwilling to undergo the fatigue of
mounting higher.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the stranger’s descent he is invited
to see the whispering gallery, which will
likewise cost two pence; he here beholds
to advantage the beautiful pavement of
the church, and from hence he has
the most advantageous view of the fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>paintings in the cupola. Here sounds are
magnified to an astonishing degree; the
least whisper is heard round the whole
circumference; the voice of one person
softly speaking against the wall on the
other side, seems as if he stood at our ear
on this, though the distance between
them is no less than an hundred and forty
feet: and the shutting of the door resounds
through the place like thunder, or
as if the whole fabric was falling asunder.
To this gallery there is an easy ascent
for persons of distinction, by a most
beautiful flight of stairs.</p>

<p class='c004'>The stranger is next invited to see the
library, the books of which are neither
numerous nor valuable; but the floor is
artfully inlaid without either nails or pegs,
and the wainscoting and book cases are not
inelegant.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next curiosity is the fine model
Sir Christopher first caused to be made for
building the new cathedral. It was not
taken from St. Peter’s at Rome, as is pretended;
but was Sir Christopher’s own
invention, and the model on which he
set the highest value; and it is a great
pity, that what was performed as the utmost
exertion of the abilities of this great
architect, should be suffered to run to decay.</p>

<p class='c004'>He is next shewn the great bell in the
south tower, which weighs 84 c. weight.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>On this bell the hammer of the great clock
strikes the hour, and on a smaller bell are
struck the quarters.</p>

<p class='c004'>The last thing shewn, are what are
vulgarly called the geometry stairs, which
are so artfully contrived as to hang together
without visible support; but this
kind of stairs, however curious in themselves,
are neither new nor uncommon.
<i>Parentalia. Historical account of the curiosities
of London</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c004'>The cathedral church of St. Paul’s is
deservedly esteemed the second in Europe,
not for magnitude only but for beauty
and grandeur. St. Peter’s at Rome is
undoubtedly the first, but at the same
time it is generally acknowledged by all
travellers of taste, that the outside, and
particularly the front of St. Paul’s, is
much superior to St. Peter’s. The two
towers at the west end, though faulty in
some respects, are yet elegant, and the
portico finely marks the principal entrance.
The loggia, crowned with a
pediment, with its alto relievo and statues,
make in the whole a fine shape,
whereas St. Peter’s is a straight line without
any break. The dome is extremely
magnificent, and by rising higher than
that at Rome, is seen to more advantage
on a near approach. The inside, though
noble, falls short of St. Peter’s. The discontinuing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the architrave of the great entablature
over the arches in the middle of
the isle, is a fault the architects can never
forgive. Notwithstanding, without a critical
examination, it appears very striking,
especially on entering the north or south
door. The side isles though small are very
elegant, and if it does not equal St. Peter’s,
there is much to be said in defence both
of it and the architect, who was not permitted
to decorate it as he intended,
through a want of taste in the managers,
who seemed to have forgot that it was
intended a national ornament. St. Peter’s
has all the advantages of painting and
sculpture of the greatest masters, and is
encrusted with a variety of the finest
marbles, no cost being spared to make it
exceed every thing of its kind. The
great geometrical knowledge of the architect
can never be sufficiently admired,
but this can be come at only by a thorough
inspection of the several parts.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the farther satisfaction of the curious
reader, we shall conclude this article
with an account of the dimensions
of St. Paul’s cathedral compared with
those of St. Peter’s at Rome, from an account
published some years ago: the measures
of the latter being taken from the
authentic dimensions of the best architects
of Rome, reduced to English measure.</p>

<p class='c004'>The original building was consumed
by the fire of London, and soon after the
present structure was raised in its place. It
is a very singular, and at the same time
a very handsome edifice. The central
building in which is the school, is of
stone; it is much lower than the ends,
and has only one series of windows, which
are large, and raised a considerable height
from the ground. The center is adorned
with rustic, and on the top is a handsome
pediment, in which are the founder’s arms
placed in a shield; upon the apex stands
a figure representing Learning. Under
this pediment are two windows which are
square, and on each side are two circular
windows crowned with busts, and the
spaces between them are handsomely ornamented
by work in relievo. Upon a
level with the foot of the pediment runs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>on either side a handsome balustrade, on
which is placed on each side a large bust
with a radiant crown, between two flaming
vases.</p>

<p class='c004'>The buildings at the ends of this elegant
structure are narrow, and rise to a
great height. They are of brick ornamented
with stone, and have each a small
door, and are crowned at the top with a
small balustrade.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Paul’s</span> <i>Shadwell</i>, owes its existence to
the increase of buildings. Shadwell,
though now joined to London, was anciently
a hamlet belonging to Stepney;
but being greatly increased in the number
of its inhabitants, Thomas Neale, Esq;
erected the present church in the year
1656 for their accommodation; and in
1669, this district was by act of parliament
constituted a distinct parish from
that of Stepney, and 120<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>
was granted for the maintenance of the
Rector in lieu of tithes, besides a considerable
glebe, oblations and church dues,

<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>has a few windows with rustic arches, and
some very mean ones in the roof. At the
corners of the building are balls placed on
a kind of small pedestals. The tower is
carried up without ornament, and is terminated
with balls at the corners in the
same manner as the body of the church,

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Peckham</span>, a pleasant village in Surry, in
the parish of Camberwell. Here is the
seat of the late Lord Trevor, built in the
reign of King James II. by Sir Thomas
Bond, who being deeply engaged in the
pernicious schemes of that imprudent
Prince, was obliged to leave the kingdom
with him, when the house was plundered
by the populace, and became forfeited
to the crown. The front of the house
stands to the north, with a spacious garden
before it, from which extends two
rows of large elms, of considerable length,
through which the Tower of London terminates
the prospect. But on each side of
this avenue you have a view of London;
and the masts of vessels appearing at high
water over the trees and houses up to
Greenwich, greatly improve the prospect.
<i>Peckham</i>, which lies on the back side of
the gardens, is shut out from the view
by plantations. The kitchen garden and
the walls were planted with the choicest
fruit trees from France, and an experienced
gardener was sent for from Paris to have
the management of them; so that the collection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>of fruit trees in this garden has
been accounted one of the best in England.</p>

<p class='c004'>After the death of the late Lord Trevor,
this seat was purchased by a private
gentleman, who began to make very considerable
improvements, and had he lived
a few years longer, would have rendered
it a very delightful retreat.</p>

<p class='c004'>There are also at Peckham several
other villas, and neat houses of retirement,
inhabited by the tradesmen of
London, and those who have retired from
business.</p>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Peckham Rye</span>, a village in Surry, on the
south side of Peckham.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Peerless Pool</span>, near Old street road, was
formerly a spring that overflowing its
banks, caused a very dangerous pond,
which from the number of persons who
lost their lives there, obtained the name
of Perilous Pool. To prevent these accidents
it was in a manner filled up, till in
the year 1743, Mr. Kemp converted it
into what may perhaps be esteemed one
of the compleatest swimming baths in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>world; and as it is the only one of the
kind in Christendom, it may deserve a
particular notice.</p>

<p class='c004'>You enter from a bowling-green on
the south side, by a neat arcade thirty-feet
long, furnished with a small collection
of modern books for the entertainment
of those subscribers who delight in
reading. Contiguous are many dressing
apartments; some of which are open,
and others rendered private, all paved with
purbeck stone; and on each side of the
bath is a bower divided into apartments
for dressing. At the other end is placed
a circular bench, capable of accommodating
forty gentlemen at a sitting, under the
shelter of a wall. One side is inclosed by
a mount 150 feet long, planted with a
great variety of shrubs, and on the top is
an agreeable terrace walk planted with
limes. The pleasure bath is 170 feet
long, and above 100 broad; it is five feet
deep at the bottom in the middle, and under
four feet at the sides, and the descent
into it is by four pair of marble steps to a
fine gravel bottom. Here is also a cold
bath, generally allowed to be the largest
in England, it being forty feet long, and
twenty feet broad, with two flights of
marble steps, and a dressing room at each
end; at four feet deep is a bottom of lettice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>work, under which the water is five
feet deep. To these the ingenious projector
has added a well stocked fish pond
320 feet long, for the diversion of those
subscribers who are fond of angling, and
adorned on each side with arbours, and
with a terrace, the slopes of which are
planted with many thousand shrubs, and the
walks one of gravel, and the other of grass,
are bordered with stately limes. The east
end the garden extends to a genteel public
house, and the westward is terminated by
another garden, and a well-built private
house inhabited by Mr. Kemp, the son
of the ingenious projector, who after
having made these improvements, changed
the name from <i>Perilous</i> to <i>Peerless
Pool</i>.</p>

drapers widows, and the same number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>seamen’s widows, to be presented by the
Churchwardens of Old Stepney parish.
Each of these almswomen have an allowance

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Penny Post Office</span>, an office unknown in
other countries, was projected by Mr.
David Murray, an upholder in Pater noster
row in the year 1683, who by this admirable
and useful project, deserves to be
considered as a benefactor to the city, and
to have his name transmitted down to posterity.
He communicated the scheme to
Mr. William Dockwra, who carried it on
for some time with great success, till the
government laid claim to it as a royal prerogative;
Dockwra was obliged to submit,
and in return had a pension of 200<i>l.</i>
<i>per annum</i> allowed him by the King during
life.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was erected for carrying letters not
only of one sheet but of several, to any
part of this great metropolis, or the adjacent
villages, on paying only one penny
on delivering the letter to be thus carried:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>but at some of the more distant villages,
an additional penny is demanded of the
person to whom the letter is delivered.</p>

<p class='c004'>This office is under the direction of the
Postmaster-general; who appoints, as
managers, a Comptroller, an Accomptant,
a Receiver and Comptroller’s clerk;
who have under their management six
sorters, and eight subsorters of letters,
seventy-four messengers, or letter-carriers,
and 334 houses within the bills of
mortality, for receiving or taking in letters,
which are divided among the six offices
following; the general office in St.
Christopher’s Church yard, and the five
offices called the sorting houses, one at
Westminster, one at Lincoln’s Inn, St.
Paul’s office, in Pater noster row, St. Mary
Overy’s in Southwark, and the Tower hill
office: besides these there are 500
shops and coffee-houses, from whence the
messengers collect and carry the letters to
their proper offices every hour, where being
sorted, they are sent out again to be
delivered. But as each of the six offices
has a number of villages under its peculiar
direction, those letters that require great
speed should be sent to that office, whose
peculiar province it is to forward them to
the village to which you would have them
sent. This renders it necessary to give a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>list of these villages and places, peculiarly
under the care of each office: but we
shall not attempt to follow the other
writers, who have prefixed to the names
of these villages the number of times to
which letters are carried to, and returned
from each; because that is entirely uncertain,
and it is sufficient that letters are
carried and returned from each at least
once a day; since this is all that can be
depended upon.</p>

round London, the extent and
limits of the Penny Post are shewn by a

walk, at the end of the new armoury, in
the Tower; was founded by King Edward
III. and dedicated by the name of
<i>St. Peter in Chains</i>, or St. Peter ad Vincula.
This is a plain Gothic building
void of all ornament, sixty-six feet in
length, fifty-four in breadth, and twenty-four
feet high from the floor to the roof.
The walls, which have Gothic windows,
are strengthened at the corners with rustic,
and crowned with a plain blocking
course. The tower is plain, and is crowned
with a turret.</p>

<p class='c004'>The living is a rectory in the gift of the
King, valued at about 60<i>l.</i> a year. The
Rector, as Minister of the Tower garrison,
is paid by his Majesty; and the living
is exempt from archiepiscopal jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among the several monuments in this

was beheaded on Tower hill on the 17th
of May, 1536.</p>

<p class='c004'>Anne Bullen, wife to King Henry VIII.

<p class='c004'>Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex,
who from a blacksmith’s son at Putney,
became the favourite of Henry VIII. and
one of the most zealous promoters of the
reformation from popery; but was beheaded
on Tower hill in the year 1540.</p>

<p class='c004'>Catharine Howard, the fifth wife of
King Henry VIII. beheaded on Tower

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland,

<p class='c011'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Peter’s</span> <i>alley</i>, by St. Peter’s church,
Cornhill.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Peter’s</span> <i>Cheap</i>, a church, which stood
at the corner of Wood street Cheapside,
in Faringdon ward within, but being destroyed
by the fire of London in 1666, the
parish was united to St. Matthew, Friday
street.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Peter’s</span> <i>Cornhill</i>, a plain neat church,
near the south east corner of Cornhill, in
the ward of that name. There has been
many ages a church in the same place,
under the patronage of the same apostle:
but the last edifice was destroyed by the
fire of London, and this substantial structure
rose in its place. The body is eighty
feet long, and forty-seven broad; it is
forty feet high to the roof, and the height
of the steeple is an hundred and forty feet.
The body is plain, and enlightened by a
single series of windows. The tower,
which is also plain, has a small window
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>in each stage, and the dome which supports
the spire is of the lantern kind; this
spire, which is well proportioned, is
crowned by a ball, whence rises the
fane, in the form of a key.</p>

<p class='c004'>The patronage of this rectory is in the
Lord Mayor and Commonalty of this city.
The Rector receives, besides other profits,
120<i>l.</i> a year by glebe, and 110<i>l.</i> a year in
lieu of tithes.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Peter le Poor</span>, on the west side of
Broad street, in the ward of that name, is
supposed by Maitland, to have received
its additional epithet <i>le Poor</i>, from the
mean condition of the parish in ancient
times: tho’ it is now extremely wealthy,
it being inhabited by a great number of
merchants, and other persons of distinction.</p>

<p class='c004'>Others imagine that it was called le
Poor, from the neighbouring friary of St.
Austin, where reigned an affected poverty.
A church stood upon the same spot
before the year 1181, and the present
edifice which escaped the fire in 1666,
is supposed to have been built about the
year 1540.</p>

<p class='c004'>This Gothic structure, instead of being
an ornament to the street in which it is
placed, as all public buildings ought to
be, is a very great deformity; the building
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>itself is mean, one of its corners being
thrust as it were into the street, renders
it narrow, obstructs the passage, and
destroys the vista. This structure is of
very considerable breadth in proportion to
its length; it being fifty-four feet long,
and fifty-one broad: the height to the
roof is twenty-three feet, and that of
the tower and turret seventy-five. The
body is plain and unornamented; the
windows are very large; and the dial is
fixed to a beam that is joined on one end
to a kind of turret, and extends like a
country sign post, across the street; a
very rude and aukward contrivance. The
tower, which rises square, without diminution,
is strengthened at the corners
with rustic; upon this is placed a turret,
which consists of strong piers at the corners
arched over, and covered with an
open dome, whence rises a ball and
fane.</p>

<p class='c004'>The advowson of this church appears
to have been all along in the Dean and
Chapter of St. Paul’s. The tithes at present
amount to 130<i>l.</i> a year; and the
other profits by annual donations settled
upon the Rector, amount to about as much
more.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Petersham</span>, a small village in Surry, near the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>New Park, and a little to the south of
Richmond hill. Here stood a delightful
seat built by the late Earl of Rochester,
Lord High Treasurer in the reign of King
James II. This fine house was burnt
down in the year 1720, so suddenly that
the family, who were all at home, had
scarcely time to save their lives. Nor was
the house, tho’ exquisitely finished both
within and without, the greatest loss sustained;
the noble furniture, the curious
collection of paintings, and the inestimable
library of the first Earl of Clarendon,
Lord High Chancellor of England, and
author of the History of the Rebellion,
were wholly consumed; and among other
valuable pieces, several manuscripts relating
to those times, and to the transactions
in which the King his Master, and
himself were engaged both at home and
abroad; besides other curious collections
made by that noble Author in foreign
countries.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the ground where his house stood,
the Earl of Harrington erected another,
after one of the Earl of Burlington’s designs.
The front next the court is very
plain, and the entrance to the house not
very extraordinary: but the south front
next the garden, is bold and regular, and
the apartments on that side, chiefly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>designed for state, are extremely elegant.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gardens were before crowded
with plantations near the house; but they
are now laid open in lawns of grass: the
kitchen garden, before situated on the
east side of the house, is removed out of
sight, and the ground converted to an
open slope of grass, leading up to a terrace
of great length; from which is a
prospect of the river Thames, the town
of Twickenham, and of all the fine seats
round that part of the country. On the
other side of the terrace, is a plantation
on a rising ground; and on the summit
of the hill is a fine pleasure house, which
on every side commands a prospect of the
country for many miles.</p>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Petticoat</span> <i>lane</i>, extends from Whitechapel
into Spitalfields. On both sides
of this lane were anciently hedges, and
rows of elm trees, and the pleasantness of
the neighbouring fields induced several
gentlemen to build their houses here, among
whom was the Spanish ambassador, whom
Strype supposes to be Gondomar: but
at length many French refugees settling
in that part of the lane near Spitalfields
in order to follow their trades, which in
general was weaving of silk, it soon became
a row of contiguous buildings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>This lane is very long and very disagreeable,

offensive smells, it being the chief residence

<p class='c004'>In the year 1534, the Wardens of the
Pewterers company, or their deputies,
were impowered by act of parliament to
have the inspection of pewter in all parts
of the kingdom, in order to prevent the
sale of the base pewter, and the importation
of pewter vessels from abroad. As a
farther encouragement, all Englishmen are
by that act strictly enjoined, not to repair
to any foreign country to teach the art or
mystery of pewterers, on pain of disfranchisement:
and for the more effectually
preventing the art being carried abroad,
no Pewterer is to take the son of an alien as
an apprentice.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Physicians.</span> There was no legal restraint
on the practice of physic, till the third
year of King Henry VIII. when it was
enacted that none should practise physic
or surgery within the city of London, of
seven miles round, unless he were first
examined, and approved by the Bishop
of London, or the Dean of St. Paul’s,
(who should call to his assistance four
Doctors of physic, and for surgery, other
expert persons in that faculty) upon pain
of forfeiting 5<i>l.</i> for every month such persons
should practise physic or surgery,
without being thus admitted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Seven years after this law, the Physicians
were incorporated into a college or
society; allowed a common seal, and the
power of annually chusing a President, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>govern all of that faculty: they were permitted
to purchase lands and tenements, and to
make statutes and ordinances for the government
and correction of the college,
and of all persons practising physic within
seven miles of the city: it was also enacted
that none, either within the city, or that
compass, should practise, unless first allowed
by the President and the Fellows, upon
pain of forfeiting 5<i>l.</i> for every month: that
four persons be chosen annually for the examination
and government of all the Physicians
of the city, and suburbs within seven
miles round, and to punish them for their
offences in not performing, making, and
neglecting their medicines and receipts, by
fines and imprisonments: and that neither
the President, nor any of the members
of the college, should be summoned upon
juries, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c004'>At their first institution there were but
thirty Fellows belonging to the college;
but at their request, King Charles II.
augmented their number to forty; and
King James II. considering the great increase of
this city in its buildings and inhabitants,
was pleased to increase the number
to eighty, which they were not to exceed.
Before this last charter, none could be admitted
a Fellow of the college, if he had
not taken his degree of Doctor in one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>the universities; but now all who have
taken their degree in any foreign university,
are qualified to become Fellows.</p>

<p class='c004'>The college has still great power in
obstructing the practise of those who are
not of their body; yet by connivance or
favour, others practise physic; tho’ by
law, if any one not so qualified, undertakes
a cure, and his patient dies under
his hand, he is deemed guilty of
felony.</p>

<p class='c004'>To this college belong a President, four
Censors, and twelve Electors. The President
is the principal member, and is annually
chosen out of the society.</p>

<p class='c004'>The four Censors have, by charter,
authority to survey, correct and govern
all Physicians, or others, that shall practise
within their jurisdiction, and to fine
and imprison for offences as they shall see
cause. They may convene any Physician
or practitioner before them, and examine
him concerning his skill in physic, and
if he does not appear to their summons,
or upon his appearance refuses to
answer, he may be fined for every default,
any sum not exceeding forty shillings;
or if any administer unwholsome
and noxious medicines, he may be fined
according to discretion, net exceeding 10<i>l.</i>
or imprisoned, not exceeding fourteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>days, unless for nonpayment of the fine,
when it shall be lawful to detain him in
prison until it be paid.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>College of</i> <span class='sc'>Physicians</span>. This society had
their first college in Knightrider street,
which was the gift of Dr. Linacre, Physician
to King Henry VIII. from whence
they afterwards removed to Amen Corner,
where they had purchased an house.
Here the great Dr. Harvey, who immortalized
his name by discovering the circulation
of the blood, built them a library
and public hall in the year 1652, which
he granted for ever to the college, with
his library, and endowed it with his
estate, which he resigned to them while
living, assigning a part of it for an anniversary
oration, in commemoration of their
benefactors, and to promote a spirit of
emulation in succeeding generations.
However, this edifice being consumed by
the fire of London, and the ground being
only upon lease, the Fellows erected the
present structure.</p>

<p><i>College of Physicians.</i><br /><i>S. Wale delin.</i>       <i>J. Taylor sc.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c005'>The College of Physicians is a very
noble edifice, situated near the north west
corner of Warwick lane. It is built with
brick and stone.</p>

<p class='c004'>The entrance, which is grand, is
under an octangular theatre, finishing
in a dome, with a cone on the top,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>making a lantern to it. The inside is
elegant, finely enlightened and very capacious.
This was built by Sir Christopher
Wren. The arches represented in the
print are under the theatre thro’ which
you enter the area. The central building,
which is well worthy of observation, is the
design of Inigo Jones, and contains the
library and other rooms of state and convenience.
The ascent to the door is by
a flight of steps, and in the under part is
a basement story. The whole front is decorated
with pilasters of the Ionic and
Corinthian orders; and on one side over
the door case, is the statue of King
Charles II. placed in a niche, and in the
other side that of Sir John Cutler. The
buildings at the two sides of the court are
uniform, and have the window cases
handsomely ornamented. The orders
are well executed, and the whole edifice
both beautiful and commodious.</p>

<p class='c004'>The College of Physicians is a building
of great delicacy, and eminently deserves
to be considered among the noblest
ornaments of this city, is yet so unlucky
in its situation, in a narrow and dirty part
of the lane, that it can never be seen to
advantage.</p>

the great roll or the pipes thereof, and
taken verbatim by the Comptroller of the
Pipe into his roll, and process may be
made by him for the recovery thereof

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Poplar</span>, a hamlet of Stepney, is situated

and obtained its name from the great

ground upon which it was built, together
with the church yard, were given by the
East India company, and the edifice
erected by the voluntary contributions of
the inhabitants and others; since which
time that Company has not only allowed
the Minister a convenient dwelling house,
with a garden and field containing about
three acres, but has allowed him 20<i>l.</i>

chapel for want of an endowment continues
unconsecrated.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Porters.</span> The London porters are divided
into brotherhoods, and consist of four
sorts, viz. Companies porters, Fellowship
porters, Ticket porters, and Tackle
porters.</p>

<p class='c004'>I. The companies porters land and ship
off all goods and merchandizes exported
and imported to and from all parts near
the west side of the Sound, in the Baltic
sea, Germany, Holland, France, Spain,
Italy, Turkey, and towards or beyond the
Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p class='c004'>II. Fellowship porters, whose business
is to land, ship off, carry or house, all
merchandize, as corn, salt, coals, and other
commodities, measurable by dry measure.
They are upward of 700 in number, and
their chief governor is the Alderman of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Billingsgate ward. Their quarterage is
12<i>d.</i> whereas the Ticket porters pay but
4<i>d.</i> each.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a very remarkable custom
among the Fellowship porters, which is
as follows, viz.</p>

<p class='c004'>By an act of Common Council, a sermon
is preached to them, in the parish church
of St. Mary at Hill, the next Sunday
after every Midsummer day; when overnight
they furnish the merchants and families
about Billingsgate with nosegays,
and in the morning they proceed from
their place of meeting in good order, each
having a nosegay in his hand: walking
through the middle isle to the communion
table, every one offers something into the
two basons, for the relief of the poor, and
towards the charges of the day; and after
they have passed, the deputy, the merchants,
their wives, children, and servants
walk in order from their seats, and
bestow their offerings also; which is a
ceremony of much variety. The charges
of their nosegays have amounted sometimes
to near 20<i>l.</i> in one year.</p>

<p class='c004'>III. The Ticket porters land and ship
off goods imported or exported to all parts
of America, &amp;c. and house all merchants
goods, metals, &amp;c. They give
ample security for their fidelity and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>honesty, and such as employ them need
only take notice of their names stamped
on a ticket that hangs at their girdles;
that upon complaint being made to their
Governor, satisfaction may be given to
such as have been injured by them.</p>

<p class='c004'>IV. Tackle porters are such of the
Ticket porters as are furnished with
weights, scales, &amp;c. and their business is
to weigh goods.</p>

It is bounded on the east, by the
parishes of Spitalfields, Stepney, and St.

<p class='c011'><i>General</i> <span class='sc'>Post Office</span>, a handsome and
commodious building near the south west
extremity of Lombard street, facing Pope’s
Head alley.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of what antiquity the post is in this
kingdom, is not easy to determine. Anciently
the management of the foreign
mails was under the direction of a stranger,
who by the permission of the government
was chosen by the foreigners dwelling
in this city, who even pretended to
have a right by prescription of chusing
their own post master. However, in the
year 1568 a difference arising between the
Spaniards and Flemings in London, each
chose their separate post master; and this
contest occasioned a representation from
the citizens to the Privy Council, to beseech
her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, to fill
that important post with one of her English
subjects.</p>

<p class='c004'>By the first accounts we find of the
posts established for the convenience of
this kingdom, it appears to have been
managed by several private officers, who
had their respective districts. But great
inconveniences arising from their different
methods of proceeding, they were suppressed,
and a certain number of public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>officers erected in their room: but these
also not answering the end proposed, a
General Post Office was erected by act of
parliament in the 12th of King Charles II.
in the year 1660, to be kept within
the city of London, under the direction
of a Post Master appointed by the
King.</p>

<p class='c004'>By this act the General Post Master was
impowered to appoint post houses in the
several parts of the country hitherto unprovided,
both in post and by-roads: the
postage of letters to and from all places
therein mentioned was not only ascertained,
but likewise the rates of post
horses to be paid by all such as should ride
post.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length, upon the union of the
kingdoms of England and Scotland, a
General Post Office was established by act
of parliament in the year 1710, not only
for the united kingdom of Great Britain,
but likewise for that of Ireland, and her
Majesty’s plantations in North America
and the West Indies.</p>

<p class='c004'>The office of Post Master is at present
under the direction of two Commissioners
who have 2000<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>, and are assisted
by a Secretary of 200<i>l.</i> a year, who
has four Clerks, two of 60<i>l.</i> a year, one of
50<i>l.</i> and one of 30<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>The other officers under the direction

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Postern Gate</span>, an ancient gate which
stood at the east end of Postern row on
Tower hill. It was erected soon after the
Conquest in a beautiful manner with
stones brought from Kent and Normandy,
for the convenience of the neighbouring
inhabitants, both within and without the
walls; but in the second year of the reign
of Richard I. William Longchamp, Bishop
of Ely, and Chancellor of England, having
resolved to enlarge and strengthen the
Tower of London with an additional
fortification, he caused a part of the city
wall, which extended about 300 feet from
the Tower to this gate, to be taken down,
in order to make way for a strong wall and
a spacious ditch: by which means the
postern being deprived of its support on
that side, fell down in the year 1440. It
was afterwards replaced by a mean building
of timber, laths and loam, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>narrow passage; but this also decayed,
and has been many years removed
quite away; nothing remaining at
present to preserve the name, but a few
posts to guard a narrow foot way from
the encroachments of horses and carriages.</p>

<p class='c004'>A little to the south of the place where
the gate stood, is a descent by several stone
steps to an excellent spring, much admired,
which is still called the Postern
Spring.</p>

of the Sheriffs, Maitland supposes, might
possibly be named the Compter, from the
prisoners being obliged to account for the
cause of their commitment before their
discharge: and the addition of Poultry is
added from its situation in that street, to
distinguish it from the Compter in Wood
street.</p>

square, principally inhabited by the families
of gentlemen who belong to the
sea. Its chief ornament is the church
and church yard belonging to the Swedes,
surrounded with iron rails and well planted
with trees. The front of the church
is carried up flat with niches and ornaments,
and on the summit is a pediment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>The body is divided into a central part
projecting forwarder than the rest, and
two sides. The central part has two tall
windows, terminated by a pediment, and
in the midst of that is an oval window;
but in the sides there is only a compartment
below with a circular window above.
The corners of the building are wrought
in a bold, plain rustic. The tower rises
square from the roof, and at the corners
are placed urns with flames: from thence
rises a turret in the lanthorn form with
flaming urns at the corners: this turret is
covered with a dome, from which rises a
ball, supporting the fane, in the form of a
rampant lion.</p>

great and honourable assembly meet in
order to consult upon those measures that
are most likely to contribute to the honour,
defence, safety and benefit of his
Majesty’s dominions.</p>

<p class='c004'>The members of this body are chosen
by the King, and are, or ought to be
distinguished by their wisdom, courage,
integrity, and political knowledge. A
Privy Counsellor, though but a Gentleman,
has precedence of all Knights, Baronets,
and the younger sons of all Barons
and Viscounts. They sit at the council board
bareheaded, when his Majesty presides;
at all debates the lowest delivers his
opinion first; and the King last of all declares
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>his judgment, and thereby determines
the matter in debate.</p>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Privy Garden</span>, Whitehall, was formerly
used as a private garden, though it extended
almost to the Cockpit. The wall
joined the arch still standing by the Cockpit,
and ran on in a line to King street.

under the government of the Lord Privy
Seal, a great officer, next in dignity to
the Lord President of the Council, who
keeps the King’s privy seal, which is set
to such grants as pass the great seal of
England. The Lord Privy Seal has a salary
of 3000<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>. Under him
are three Deputies, a Secretary, and three
Clerks; but these Clerks have no salaries;
they have however considerable fees, and
30<i>l.</i> a year board wages.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Protonotaries</span>, or <span class='sc'>Prothonotaries</span>,
in the court of Common Pleas. The
word is derived from <i>Protonotarius</i>, a chief
Notary or Clerk; and they are accordingly
the chief Clerks of this court.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>They enter and enrol all declarations,
pleadings, assizes, judgments, and actions;
and make out judicial writs, &amp;c. for all
English counties, except Monmouth.
They are three in number, and have each
separate offices, one in the Middle Temple,
another in King’s Bench Walks, and the
other in Searle’s court, Lincoln’s Inn. In
these offices all the Attorneys of the court
of Common Pleas enter their causes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Each of these Protonotaries has a Secondary,
whose office is, to draw up the
rules of court, and these were formerly the

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Pudding</span> <i>lane</i>, Thames street. In this lane
the fire of London broke out, at a house
situated exactly at the same distance from
the Monument as that is high. Upon
this house, which is rebuilt in a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>handsome manner, was set up by authority
the following inscription:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Here by the permission of Heaven,
Hell broke loose upon this protestant
city, from the malicious hearts of barbarous
papists, by the hand of their
agent <span class='sc'>Hubert</span>: who confessed, and on
the ruins of this place declared his fact,
for which he was hanged, viz. That
here began the dreadful fire, which is
described and perpetuated, on and by
the neighbouring pillar, erected 1681—in
the mayoralty of Sir Patience Ward,
Knt.’</p>

<p class='c004'>But the inhabitants being incommoded
by the many people who came to look at
the house, and read this board, it was
taken down a few years ago.</p>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Puddle</span> <i>dock</i>, Thames street. There was
anciently a descent into the Thames in
this place, where horses used to be watered;

this circumstance, and from a person
named Puddle dwelling there, this dock,
according to Maitland, obtained its present

the citizens of London have many
pretty seats; and on Putney Heath is a
public house, noted for polite assemblies,
and in the summer season for breakfasting
and dancing, and for one of the pleasantest
bowling greens in England. Here is an
old church erected after the same model
with that of Fulham, on the opposite

public places of pleasure which is not to
be equalled in Europe, and is the resort
of people of the first quality. Though its
gardens are beautiful, it is more to be admired
for the amphitheatre. This is a
circular building, the external diameter is
185 feet, round the whole is an arcade,
and over that a gallery with a balustrade
(to admit the company into the upper

of the inside corresponds with the outside,
except that over every column, between
the windows, termini support the roof.
In the middle of the area, where the orchestra
was at first designed, is a chimney
having four faces. This makes it warm
and comfortable in bad weather. The
orchestra fills up the place of one of the
entrances. The entertainment consists of
a fine band of music with an organ, accompanied
by the best voices. The regale

customs, excise, subsidies: all aids granted
to the King in Parliament; and every
thing relating to his Majesty’s revenue,
whether certain or casual: all securities,
either by bonds or recognizances, given to

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Reygate</span>, a large market town in Surry,
situated in the valley of Holmsdale,
twenty-four miles from London, and surrounded
on each side with hills. It is an
ancient borough, and had a castle, built
by the Saxons, on the east side of the
town, some ruins of which are still to be
seen, particularly a long vault with a room
at the end, large enough to hold 500
persons, where the Barons who took up
arms against King John are said to have
had their private meetings. Its market
house was once a chapel dedicated to
Thomas Becket. The neighbourhood
abounds with fullers earth and medicinal
plants.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the south side of the town is a large
house, formerly a priory: it belongs to
the late Mr. Parsons’s family, and is
beautified with plantations, and a large
piece of water. It has two rooms, each
fifty feet long, and of a proportionable
breadth; but the ceilings are much too
low. The house and gardens are on every
side surrounded with hills, so as to render
the prospect very romantic.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this town the late celebrated Lord
Shaftesbury had an house, to which he
retired to seclude himself from company.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>It is now in the possession of a private
gentleman, who has laid out and planted
a small spot of ground, in so many parts,
as to comprise whatever can be supposed
in the most noble seats. It may properly
be called a model, and is called by the
inhabitants of Reygate, <i>The world in one

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Richmond</span>, a village in Surry, twelve miles
from London. This is reckoned the finest
village in the British dominions, and has
therefore been termed the <i>Frescati</i> of
England. It was anciently the seat of
our Monarchs, and the palace from its
splendor was called <i>Shene</i>, which in the
Saxon tongue signifies bright or shining;
Here King Edward III. died of grief for
the loss of his heroic son Edward the
Black Prince; and here died Anne the
wife of Richard II. who first taught the
English women the use of the side saddle;
for before her time they were used to ride
astride; Richard, however, was so afflicted
at her death, that it gave him such a dislike
to the place where it happened, that
he defaced the fine palace; but it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>repaired and beautified afresh by King
Henry V. who also founded near it three
religious houses. In the year 1497, this
palace was destroyed by fire, when King
Henry VII. was there; but in 1501
that Prince caused it to be new built,
and commanded that the village should be
called Richmond; he having borne the
title of Earl of Richmond, before he obtained
the crown by the defeat and death of
Richard III. Henry VII. died here; and
here also his grand-daughter Queen Elizabeth
breathed her last. On the ground
where formerly stood a part of the old
palace, the Earl of Cholmondeley has a
seat, as has also Mr. Wray.</p>

<p class='c004'>The present palace, which is finely situated,
is a very plain edifice built by the
Duke of Ormond, who received a grant
of a considerable space of land about
Richmond, from King William III. as a
reward for his military services; but it devolved
to the Crown on that Duke’s attainder,
in the beginning of the reign of
King George I. and this house was by his
present Majesty confirmed to the late
Queen Caroline, in case she became
Queen Dowager of England.</p>

<p class='c004'>His Majesty took great delight here,
and made several improvements in the
palace, while her Majesty amused herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>at her royal dairy house, Merlin’s cave,
the Hermitage, and the other improvements
which she made in the park and
gardens of this delightful retreat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Though the palace is unsuitable to the
dignity of a King of England, the gardens
are extremely fine, without offering a
violence to nature; and Pope’s advice with
respect to planting, may be considered as
a very accurate description of the beauties
to be found here.</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>To build, to plant, whatever you intend,</div>
      <div class='line'>To rear the column, or the arch to bend;</div>
      <div class='line'>To swell the terrace, or to sink the grot,</div>
      <div class='line'>In all let Nature never be forgot:</div>
      <div class='line'>Consult the genius of the place in all,</div>

    </div>

</div>

<p class='c005'>In short, almost every thing here has an
agreeable wildness, and a pleasing irregularity,
that cannot fail to charm all who
are in love with nature, and afford a much
higher and more lasting satisfaction than
the stiff decorations of art, where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>artist loses sight of nature which alone
ought to direct his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>On entering these rural walks, you are
conducted to the dairy, a neat but low
brick building, to which there is an ascent
by a flight of steps; in the front is a
handsome angular pediment. The walls
on the inside are covered with stucco, and
the house is furnished suitably to a royal
dairy, the utensils for the milk being of
the most beautiful china.</p>

<p class='c004'>Passing by the side of a canal, and thro’
a grove of trees, the temple presents itself
to view, situated on a mount. It is a circular
dome crowned with a ball, and supported
by Tuscan columns, with a circular
altar in the middle, and to this temple
there is an ascent by very steep slopes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Returning by the dairy, and crossing
the gravel walk, which leads from the
palace to the river, you come to a wood,
which you enter by a walk terminated
by the Queen’s pavilion, a neat elegant
structure, wherein is seen a beautiful
chimney-piece, taken from a design in the
addition to Palladio, and a model of a
palace intended to be built in this place.</p>

<p class='c004'>In another part of the wood is the
Duke’s summer house, which has a lofty
arched entrance, and the roof rising to a
point is terminated by a ball.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>On leaving the wood you come to the
summer house on the terrace, a light small
building with very large and lofty windows,
to give a better view of the country,
and particularly of that noble seat
called Sion house. In this edifice are two
good pictures, representing the taking of
Vigo by the Duke of Ormond.</p>

<p class='c004'>Passing through a labyrinth, you see,
near a pond, Merlin’s cave, a Gothic
building thatched; within which are the
following figures in wax, Merlin, an ancient
British enchanter; the excellent and
learned Queen Elizabeth, and a Queen of
the Amazons; here is also a library consisting
of a well chosen collection of the
works of modern authors neatly bound in
vellum.</p>

<p class='c004'>On leaving this edifice, which has an
antique and venerable appearance, you
come to a large oval of above 500 feet in
diameter, called the Forest oval, and turning
from hence you have a view of the
Hermitage, a grotesque building, which
seems as if it had stood many hundred
years, though it was built by order of
her late Majesty. It has three arched
doors, and the middle part which projects
forward, is adorned with a kind of ruinous
angular pediment; the stones of the whole
edifice appear as if rudely laid together,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>and the venerable look of the whole is
improved by the thickness of the solemn
grove behind, and the little turret on the
top with a bell, to which you may ascend
by a winding walk. The inside is in the
form of an octagon with niches, in which
are the busts of the following truly great
men, who by their writings were an honour
not only to their country, but to human
nature. The first on the right hand
is the incomparable Sir Isaac Newton, and
next to him the justly celebrated Mr.
John Locke. The first on the left hand
is Mr. Woolaston, the author of The Religion
of Nature displayed; next to him is
the reverend and learned Dr. Samuel
Clarke, and in a kind of alcove is the truly
honourable Mr. Robert Boyle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Leaving this seat of contemplation, you
pass through fields cloathed with grass;
through corn fields, and a wild ground
interspersed with broom and furze, which
afford excellent shelter for hares and pheasants,
and here there are great numbers of
the latter very tame. From this pleasing
variety, in which nature appears in all
her forms of cultivation and barren wildness,
you come to an amphitheatre formed
by young elms, and a diagonal wilderness,
through which you pass to the forest walk,
which extends about half a mile, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>then passing through a small wilderness,
you leave the gardens.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the extremity of the garden on the
north east, is another house that belonged
to her Majesty, and near it the house of
his late Royal Highness Frederic Prince
of Wales, which is on the inside adorned
with stucco. Opposite the Prince’s house
is the Princess Amelia’s, built by a Dutch
architect, the outside of which is painted.</p>

<p class='c004'>To the west of the gardens are seen the
fine houses of several of the nobility
and gentry, particularly the Lady Buckworth’s,
and Mr. Geoffrey’s, and extending
the view across the Thames, there
appears Isleworth.</p>

<p class='c004'>But to return to the village of Richmond.
The Green is extremely pleasant,
it being levelled and enclosed in a handsome
manner; it is also surrounded with
lofty elms, and adorned on each side with
the houses of persons of distinction. A
sun dial is here affixed in a pretty taste,
encompassed with seats: this, and the
railing in of the Green, were at the sole
charge of her late Majesty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among the pretty seats on this spacious
Green, is a handsome edifice that formerly
belonged to Sir Charles Hedges, and since
to Sir Matthew Decker, in the gardens of
which is said to be the longest and highest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>hedge of holly that was ever seen, with
several other hedges of evergreens; there
are here also vistas cut through woods,
grottos, fountains, a fine canal, a decoy,
summer house and stove houses, in which
the anana, or pine-apple, was first brought
to maturity in this kingdom.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the north east side of the Green is
a fine house, which belonged to the late
Mr. Heydigger, and a little beyond it that
of the Duke of Cumberland; passing by
which, you come to a small park belonging
to his Majesty, well stocked with
deer, and opposite to it is the entrance
into the gardens.</p>

<p class='c004'>The town runs up the hill above a mile
from the village of East Shene, to the
New Park, with the royal gardens sloping
all the way towards the Thames; whose
tide reaches to this village, though it is
sixty miles from the sea; which is a
greater distance than the tide is carried by
any other river in Europe.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the ascent of the hill are wells of a
purging mineral water, frequented during
the summer by a great deal of good company.
On the top there is a most extensive
and beautiful prospect of the country,
interspersed with villages and inclosures;
the Thames is seen running beneath, and
the landscape is improved by the many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>fine seats that are scattered along its
banks.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is here an almshouse built by
Dr. Duppa, Bishop of Winchester in the
reign of King Charles II. for the support
of ten poor widows, pursuant to a vow
made by that Prelate during that Prince’s
exile. There is another almshouse endowed
with above 100<i>l.</i> a year, which, since
its foundation, has been considerably increased
by John Mitchell, Esq; Here are
also two charity schools, one for fifty boys,
and the other for fifty girls.</p>

<p class='c004'>New Park, in Surry, is situated between
Kingston and Richmond. This is one of
the best parks in England; it was made
in the reign of King Charles I. and inclosed
with a brick wall, said to be eleven miles
in compass. In this park there is a little
hill cast up, called King Henry’s Mount,
from which is a prospect of six counties,
with a distant view of the city of London,
and of Windsor Castle.</p>

<p class='c004'>The new lodge in this park, built by
the late Sir Robert Walpole Earl of Orford,
is a very elegant edifice. It is built
of stone in a square form, with wings on
each side of brick. It stands on a rising
ground, and commands a very good prospect
of the park, especially of that fine
piece of water which is in it, and which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>might be enlarged and brought across the
vista which is in the front of the house,
through a wood. This park is the largest
of any within the environs of London, except
that of Windsor, and the finest too;
for though it has little more than a wild
variety of natural beauties to shew, yet
these are such as cannot fail to please those
who are as much delighted with views in
their rudest appearance, as in all the elegance
of art and design. The Princess
Amelia resides in the old lodge; the new
lodge is not inhabited.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Rolls Office and Chapel</span>, in Chancery
lane, a house founded by King Henry III.
in the place where stood a Jew’s house
forfeited to that Prince in the year 1233.
In this chapel all such Jews and infidels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>as were converted to the Christian faith,
were ordained, and in the buildings belonging
to it, were appointed a sufficient
maintenance: by which means a great
number of converts were baptized, instructed
in the doctrines of Christianity,
and lived under a learned Christian appointed
to govern them: but in the year
1290, all the Jews being banished, the
number of converts decreased, and in the
year 1377, the house with its chapel was
annexed by patent to the Keeper of the
Rolls of Chancery.</p>

<p class='c004'>The chapel, which is of brick, pebbles
and some freestone, is sixty feet long, and
thirty-three in breadth; the doors and
windows are Gothic, and the roof covered
with slate. In this chapel the rolls
are kept in presses fixed to the sides, and
ornamented with columns and pilasters of
the Ionic and Composite orders.</p>

<p class='c004'>These rolls contain all the records, as
charters, patents, &amp;c. since the beginning
of the reign of Richard III. those before
that time being deposited in the Record
Office in the Tower: and these being
made up in rolls of parchment gave occasion
to the name.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the north west angle of this chapel
is a bench, where the Master of the Rolls
hears causes in Chancery. And attendance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>is daily given in this chapel from ten
o’clock till twelve, for taking in and paying
out money, according to order of
court, and for giving an opportunity to
those who come for that purpose to
search the rolls.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Minister of the chapel is appointed
by the Master of the Rolls, and divine
service is performed there on Sundays and
holidays at about eleven and three.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the walls are several old monuments,
particularly at the East end is that
of Dr. Young Master of the Rolls, who
died in the year 1516. In a well wrought
stone coffin lies the effigies of Dr. Young,
in a scarlet gown; his hands lie across
upon his breast, and a cap with corners
covers his ears. On the wall just above
him, our Saviour is looking down upon
him, his head and shoulders appearing
out of the clouds, accompanied by two
angels.</p>

<p class='c004'>The office of the Rolls is under the government
of the Master of the Rolls, whose
house is by the chapel, and has been lately
rebuilt in a handsome manner at the public
expence.</p>

<p class='c004'>The place of Master of the Rolls is an
office of great dignity, and is in the gift
of the King, either for life, or during
pleasure.  He is always the principal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Master in Chancery, and has in his gift the
offices of the Six Clerks in Chancery; of
the Two Examiners of the same court,
and of the Clerk of the Chapel of the
Rolls, who acts immediately under him in
that office. He has several revenues belonging
to the office of the Rolls, and by
act of Parliament receives a salary of
1200<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i> out of the hanaper.

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Royal Exchange</span>, Cornhill. This edifice,
which is dedicated to the service of
commerce, was founded by Sir Thomas
Gresham, a merchant distinguished by
his abilities and great success in trade,
who proposed, that if the city would prepare
a proper spot, he would erect the
building at his own expence. This proposal
was accepted by the Lord Mayor
and citizens, who purchased some houses
between Cornhill and Threadneedle street,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>and having caused them to be pulled down
and cleared away, the foundation of the
new building was laid on the 7th of June
1566, and carried on with such expedition,
that it was finished in November
1567.</p>

<p class='c004'>This edifice was called the Bourse, but
it soon after changed its name; for on the
23d of January 1570, Queen Elizabeth,
attended by a great number of the nobility,
came from Somerset house, her palace
in the Strand, and passing through
Threadneedle street, dined with Sir Thomas
Gresham at his house in Bishopsgate
street, and after dinner returning through
Cornhill, entered the Bourse on the south
side, where having viewed every part except
the vaults, especially the gallery above
stairs, which extended round the whole
building, and was furnished with shops,
in which were sold all sorts of the finest
wares in the city, her Majesty caused this
edifice to be proclaimed in her presence,
by a herald and trumpet, <i>The Royal Exchange</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sir Thomas Gresham, at his death, left
the building to his Lady, and after her decease
to the Lord Mayor and citizens, and
to the Mercers company, directing the
rents to support, under their inspection,
lectures on the sciences, at his dwelling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>house, now Gresham College, and some
charities to the prisons.</p>

<p class='c004'>The original building stood till the fire
of London in 1666, when it perished
amidst the general havoc: but it soon
arose with greater splendor than before.
The model of the present structure was first
shewn to King Charles II. who was well
pleased with it, it was however debated
whether they should build after that model
or not; for fear of launching out into
too great an expence: but the majority
desiring to have it a magnificent structure,
and imagining, that the shops above and
below stairs would in time reimburse
them, had the present edifice erected at
the expence of 80,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>The ground plat of this building is 203
feet in length; 171 feet in breadth, and
the area in the middle is 61 square
perches. This area is surrounded with a
substantial and regular stone building,
wrought in rustic. In each of the principal
fronts is a piazza, and in the center
are the grand entrances into the
area, under an arch which is extremely
lofty and noble; on each side that of the
principal front which is in Cornhill, are
Corinthian demi-columns supporting a
compass pediment; and in the intercolumniation
on each side, in the front next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>the street, is a niche with the figures of
King Charles I. and his son Charles II.
in Roman habits, and well executed.
Over the aperture on the cornice between
the two pediments are the King’s arms in
relievo. On each side of this entrance is
a range of windows placed between demi-columns
and pilasters of the Composite
order, above which runs a balustrade.
The height of the building is fifty-six
feet, and from the center of this side rises
a lantern and turret, 178 feet high, on the
top of which is a fane in the form of a
grasshopper of polished brass, esteemed a
very fine piece of workmanship: a grasshopper
being the crest of Sir Thomas
Gresham’s arms.</p>

<p class='c004'>The north front of the Royal Exchange
is adorned with pilasters of the Composite
order, but has neither columns nor statues
on the outside, and instead of the two
compass pediments has a triangular one.</p>

<p class='c004'>Within the piazzas of these two fronts
are two spacious stair cases with iron rails,
and black marble steps; these lead into a
kind of gallery that extends round the
four sides of the building, and in which
were about two hundred shops, that
have been let from 20<i>l.</i> to 60<i>l.</i> a year
each; and a very considerable trade was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>carried on here; but it has long declined,
and all the shops are deserted.</p>

<p class='c004'>One side of this gallery is employed as
auction rooms for furniture, and in other
apartments above stairs are the Royal Exchange
Assurance office, &amp;c. and in the
vaults are the pepper warehouse of the
East India company.</p>

<p class='c004'>The inside of the area is surrounded
with piazzas like those of the south and
north fronts; forming ambulatories for
the merchants to shelter themselves from
the weather. Above the arches of these
piazzas is an entablature with curious enrichments;
and on the cornice a range of
pilasters with an entablature extending
round, and a compass pediment in the middle
of the cornice of each of the four sides.
Under that on the north are the King’s
arms; on the south those of the city; on
the east those of Sir Thomas Gresham;
and under the pediment on the west side
the arms of the company of Mercers,
with their respective enrichments.</p>

<p class='c004'>In these intercolumns are twenty-four
niches, nineteen of which are filled with
the statues of the Kings and Queens of
England, standing erect, drafted in their
robes and with their regalia, except the
statues of Charles II. and George II.
which are dressed like the Cæsars.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>These statues are, on the south side;
Edward I. Edward III. Henry V. Henry
VI. On the west side, Edward IV. Edward
V. with the crown hanging over his
head; Henry VII. and Henry VIII. On
the north side, Edward VI. Mary, Elizabeth,
James I. Charles I. Charles II. and
James II. And on the east side are William
and Mary in one niche, Queen Anne,
George I. and George II. All these statues
were painted and gilt, by a voluntary
subscription, in the year 1754.</p>

<p class='c004'>The four niches that are vacant, are
those where Edward II.  Richard II.
Henry IV. and Richard III. should have
been: upon which Maitland says, that
hence it seems that the city had no mind
to shew any respect to the said Kings, two
of whom took away their charters, and
the other two were usurpers.  But why
Henry IV. should be excluded as an usurper,
and his brave son Henry V. and
Henry VI. be placed there, who only enjoyed
the crown in consequence of his
usurpation, is not easily accounted for.
Richard III. was indeed a monster of
cruelty: but Mary was no less cruel, and
yet a statue is here erected to her honour.
Though Edward II. and Richard II. took
away the charter of the city, King Charles
II. did so too, and yet has three statues at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>the Royal Exchange; and his brother James
II. who has also a statue, followed his
brother’s steps, and not only humbled the
city, but caused an Alderman to be hanged
at his own door, without being allowed
on his trial the time necessary to send for
his witnesses.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under the piazzas within the Exchange
are twenty-eight niches, all vacant except
two; one in the north west angle, where
is the statue of Sir Thomas Gresham, and
another at the south west, of Sir John
Barnard, who is perhaps the only citizen
of London, that has had the honour of
having his statue erected in his life-time
merely on account of his merit.</p>

<p class='c004'>In short, in the center of the area
is erected, on a marble pedestal about
eight feet high, another statue of King
Charles II. in a Roman habit, executed
by Mr. Gibbon, and encompassed with
iron rails. On the south side of the pedestal,
under an imperial crown, a scepter,
sword, palm branches, and other decorations,
is the following inscription:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c025'>

    <div>Patriæ Patri,</div>

    <div>Anno Salutis Humanæ M. DC. LXXXIV.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On the west side of this pedestal, is cut
in relievo, a Cupid resting his right hand
on a shield, containing the arms of
France and England quartered, and holding
in his left a rose.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the north side are the arms of Ireland
on a shield, supported by a Cupid.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the south side is the following inscription
on the base of the pedestal:</p>
<p class='c026'>‘This statue was repaired and beautified
by the company of Merchant
Adventurers of England, <i>anno</i> 1730;
John Hanbury, Esq; Governor.’</p>
<p class='c005'>On the east side are the arms of Scotland,
with a Cupid holding a thistle. All
done in relievo.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the area on the inside of the Royal
Exchange, merchants meet every day at
twelve at noon, and a prodigious concourse
of those of all nations continue there
till two, in order to transact business; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>soon after that hour the gates are shut up,
and not opened again till four. For the
readier dispatch of business, and that
every particular merchant may be easily
found, they are disposed in separated
classes, each of which have their particular
station, called their walk, as may
be seen at one view by the following
plan, by attending to which any merchant
may easily be found.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Royal Exchange, without critical
examination, has something grand in it,
and the entrance would certainly appear to
more advantage if it were not incumbered
with a parcel of little shops. The arcade
or walks within the quadrangle have
something noble, but the upper part is in
a very bad taste. The statue of King
Charles II. in the middle of the area is a
good one. The other statues in the several
niches have been lately new painted
and gilt in parts. The painting is no
doubt very necessary for their preservation,
but it were to be wished the gilding of
them had been omitted, as it must give
foreigners of judgment (and such sometimes
frequent this place) a contemptible
opinion of our taste. The two statues,
one on each side the gate, of King Charles
I. and II. are particularly good. The
clock tower or steeple with Gothic windows
is unpardonable, and the cornices at
their angles are so broke, as to appear very
disgustful to an architect.</p>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Royal Exchange Assurance Office</span>,
for assuring houses and other buildings,
goods, wares and merchandize from fire.
This corporation was established by act of
Parliament, at the same time with that of
the London Assurance, when it was enacted,
that such as should be admitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>members of these corporations, should be
each a distinct and separate body politic,
for the assurance of goods, ships and merchandize
at sea, or for lending money upon
bottomry.</p>

<p class='c004'>That no other society should insure
ships, or lend money on bottomry for the
future; though any private person might
do it as usual.</p>

<p class='c004'>And that each of these corporations,
in consideration of the many benefits that
might accrue to them by their charters,
should pay the sum of 300,000<i>l.</i> into his
Majesty’s Exchequer, for discharging the
debts of the civil list.</p>

<p class='c004'>These corporations however met with
so little encouragement at first, that Maitland
says, the crown was obliged to remit
most part of the money.</p>

<p class='c004'>By a second charter granted to this corporation,
they are impowered not only to
insure ships, but houses, goods and lives.
<i>Maitland.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>This society therefore, by this last mentioned
charter, assure all buildings, household
furniture, wearing apparel by special
agreement, and goods, wares, and merchandize,
the property of the assured,
except glass and china ware not in trade,
and all manner of writings, books of accompts,
notes, bills, bonds, tallies, ready
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>money, jewels, plate, pictures, gunpowder,
hay, straw, and corn unthreshed, from loss
or damage by fire, upon the following
conditions.</p>

<p class='c004'>I. All manner of stone and brick buildings,
covered with slate, tile, or lead,
wherein no hazardous trades are carried
on, nor any hazardous goods deposited,
are considered as Common Assurances,
and are assured upon these terms: any
sum above 100<i>l.</i> and not exceeding 1000<i>l.</i>
at 2<i>s.</i> <i>per cent. per annum</i>; any sum above
1000<i>l.</i> and not exceeding 3000<i>l.</i> at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
<i>per cent. per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>II. To accommodate those who are desirous
of being assured for a term of years,
this corporation will assure on such buildings
or goods, any sum not exceeding 1000<i>l.</i> at
the rate of 12<i>s.</i> <i>per cent.</i> for seven years,
and as far as 2000<i>l.</i> at the rate of 14<i>s.</i> <i>per
cent.</i> without subjecting the assured to any
calls or contributions to make good losses.</p>

<p class='c004'>III. Assurances on buildings and goods,
are deemed distinct and separate adventures;
so that the premium on goods is
not advanced by reason of any assurance
on the building wherein the goods are
kept, nor the premium on the building by
reason of any assurance on the goods.</p>

<p class='c004'>IV. Plaister or timber buildings covered
with lead, tile, or slate, wherein no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>hazardous trades are carried on, nor any
hazardous goods deposited; and goods or
merchandize not hazardous in such buildings,
are termed Hazardous Assurances,
and insured upon the following terms:
any sum above 100<i>l.</i> and not exceeding
1000<i>l.</i> at 3<i>s.</i> <i>per cent. per annum</i>: any
sum above 1000<i>l.</i> and not exceeding 2000<i>l.</i>
at 4<i>s.</i> <i>per cent. per annum</i>: and any sum
above 2000<i>l.</i> and not exceeding 3000<i>l.</i> at
5<i>s.</i> <i>per cent. per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>V. Hazardous trades, such as apothecaries,
colourmen, bread and bisket bakers,
ship and tallow chandlers, innholders and
stable-keepers, carried on in brick or stone
buildings, covered with slate, tile, or lead;
and hazardous goods, such as hemp, flax,
pitch, tar, tallow, and turpentine, deposited
in such buildings, may be assured at
the annual premiums, set down under the
head of Hazardous Assurances, in the
above article.</p>

<p class='c004'>VI. Any of the above hazardous trades
carried on, or hazardous goods deposited in
timber or plaister buildings; earthen,
glass, or china ware in trade, and thatched
buildings, or goods therein, are termed
Doubly Hazardous Assurances, and may
be assured on the following premiums:
any sum above 100<i>l.</i> and not exceeding
1000<i>l.</i> at 5<i>s.</i> <i>per cent. per annum</i>: and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>any sum above 1000<i>l.</i> and not exceeding
3000<i>l.</i> at 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>per cent. per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>VII. Assurances of mills, wearing apparel,
and assurances to chemists, distillers,
and sugar-bakers, or any other assurances
more than ordinarily hazardous,
by reason of the trade, nature of the goods,
narrowness of the place, or other dangerous
circumstances, may be made by special
agreement.</p>

<p class='c004'>VIII. Two dwelling houses, or any one
dwelling house, and the out-houses thereunto
belonging, or any one dwelling
house, and goods therein, may be included
in the sum of 100<i>l.</i> But when several
buildings, or buildings and goods are assured
in the same policy, the sum assured
on each is to be particularly mentioned.</p>

<p class='c004'>IX. To prevent frauds, if any buildings
or goods assured by this corporation, are,
or shall be assured with any other corporation
or society, the policy granted by this
corporation is to be null and void, unless
such other assurance is allowed by endorsement
on the policy.</p>

<p class='c004'>X. Every person upon application to
be assured with this company, is to deposite
8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the policy and mark, which
8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> is to be returned, if the assurance
proposed is not agreed to. No policy is
to be of any force, till the premium for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>one year is paid. And for all subsequent
annual payments made at the office, the
assured are to take receipts, stamped with
the seal of the corporation, no other being
allowed of.</p>

<p class='c004'>XI. No policy is to be extended, or
construed to extend to the assurance of
any hazardous buildings or goods, unless
they are expressly mentioned in the policy,
and the respective premium for such assurances
be paid for the same.</p>

<p class='c004'>XII. No loss or damage by fire happening
by any invasion, foreign enemy,
or any military or usurped power whatsoever,
is to be made good.</p>

<p class='c004'>XIII. All persons assured by this corporation,
are, upon any loss or damage by
fire, forthwith to give notice thereof by
letter or otherwise, to the Directors or Secretary,
at their office in the Royal Exchange,
London; and within fifteen days
after such fire, deliver in as particular an
account of their loss or damage, as the nature
of the case will admit of, and make
proof of the same, by the oath or affirmation
of themselves, and their domestics, or
servants, and by their books of accompts,
or other proper vouchers, as shall be required;
and also to procure a certificate
under the hands of the Minister and
Church-wardens, together with some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>other reputable inhabitants of the parish,
not concerned in such loss, importing,
that they are well acquainted with the
character and circumstances of the sufferer
or sufferers; and do know, or verily believe,
that he, she, or they, have really and
by misfortune, sustained by such fire, the
loss and damage therein mentioned. And
in case any difference shall arise between
the corporation and the assured, touching
any loss or damage, such difference shall
be submitted to the judgment and determination
of arbitrators indifferently chosen,
whose award in writing shall be conclusive
and binding to all parties. And
when any loss or damage is settled and
adjusted, the sufferer or sufferers are to receive
immediate satisfaction for the same.</p>

<p class='c004'>In adjusting losses on houses, no wainscot,
painting, sculpture, or carved work,
is to be valued at more than three shillings
<i>per</i> yard.</p>

<p class='c004'>Any larger sum, and some of the goods
excepted in the preamble, may be assured
by special agreement.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the timely assistance of such as are
assured, this corporation has several engines
and men, with proper instruments to
extinguish fires, and also porters for removing
goods, each of whom has a badge,
upon which is the figure of the Royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Exchange, and the badges are all numbered;
of which all persons are desired to
take notice who intrust them with goods,
or have any complaint to make. The
same figure is fixed on buildings assured
by this corporation.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Royal Exchange Assurance office
is under the management of a Governor,
Sub-Governor, Deputy-Governor, and
twenty-four Directors; besides whom
there are a Treasurer, a Secretary, an
Accomptant, and several Clerks.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Royal Society</span>, in Crane court, Fleet
street. This society, which took its rise from
a private society of learned and ingenious
men, was founded for the improvement
of natural knowledge. The honourable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Robert Boyle, Sir William Petty, Dr.
Seth Ward, Dr. Wilkins, Dr. Wallis,
Dr. Goddard, Dr. Willis, Dr. Bathurst,
and Dr. Wren, together with Mr. Matthew
Wren and Mr. Rook, frequently
met in the apartments of Dr. Wilkins, in
Wadham College, at Oxford, to discourse
on philosophical subjects; and there the
learned productions of these gentlemen,
not only eminently distinguished that society
at home, but also rendered it highly
revered by the <i>literati</i> abroad.</p>

<p class='c004'>The meetings of these <i>literati</i>, which
began about the year 1650, continued at
Oxford till 1658, when the members being
called to different parts of the kingdom,
on account of their respective functions;
and the majority coming to this
city, they constantly attended the astronomical
and geometrical lectures at Gresham
college, where, being joined by several
persons of the greatest learning and
distinction, they continued to meet there
once or twice a week, till the death of
Oliver Cromwell: when anarchy succeeding,
they were obliged to quit their place
of meeting, on account of its being converted
into military quarters for the reception
of soldiers.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, the storm being soon after
allayed by the restoration of King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>Charles II. the society began to resume
their meetings, and for the more effectually
carrying them on, entered into an
obligation to pay each one shilling a
week, towards the defraying of occasional
charges.</p>

<p class='c004'>From these small beginnings, this society
soon arose to be one of the most
celebrated in all Europe: for their design
being favoured by some ingenious men
who had followed the King in his exile,
his Majesty granted them a charter, dated
the 15th of July 1662, and then a second
charter, dated the 22d of April 1663,
whereby they were denominated, <i>The Royal
Society</i>, and made a corporation, to consist
of a President, Council, and Fellows, for
promoting natural knowledge and useful
arts, by experiments; in this charter his
Majesty declared himself their founder and
patron, giving them power to make laws
for the government of themselves; to purchase
lands and houses; to have a common
seal, and a coat of arms.</p>

<p class='c004'>No sooner was this Royal Society thus
incorporated by King Charles II. than that
Prince made them a present of a fine silver
mace gilt, to be carried before the President;
and as a farther mark of favour,
their royal patron, by his letters patent of
the 8th of April 1667, gave them Chelsea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>college with its appurtenances, and twenty-six
or twenty-seven acres of land surrounding
it. But afterwards the society neglecting
to convert a part of it into a
physic garden, as was intended, and the
King being resolved to erect an hospital
for old and maimed soldiers, thought no
place more proper for such a design than
this college; he therefore purchased it
again of them for a considerable sum.</p>

<p class='c004'>A little before the society received these
letters patent from his Majesty, the honourable
Henry Howard, afterwards Duke
of Norfolk, made them a present of a very
valuable library, on the 2d of January
1666.</p>

<p class='c004'>This collection was part of the royal
library belonging to the Kings of Hungary,
originally kept at the city of Buda.
Upon the decease of Matthias Corvinus,
the last King of the Hungarian race, it was
disposed of, and about two thirds of the
books were bought by the Emperor, and
are now in the imperial library at Vienna:
the remaining part coming to Bilibaldus
Perkeymherus of Nuremberg, it was purchased
of him by the Earl of Arundel, on
his return from his embassy to the imperial
court.</p>

<p class='c004'>This fine collection consists of 3287
printed books in most languages and faculties;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>chiefly the first editions soon after
the invention of printing; and a valuable
collection of manuscripts in Hebrew,
Greek, Latin, and Turkish, amounting to
554 volumes, which, together with the
former, are thought to be of such value as
not to be parallelled, for the smallness of
their number.</p>

<p class='c004'>The noble benefactor, at the time of
his donation, desired that the inscription
of, <i>Ex dono Henrici Howard Norfolkciensis</i>,
might be put in each book: and that in
case the society should happen to fail, the
library should revert to his family. This
the society not only readily complied
with, but some years after caused the
following inscription to be set up in the
library:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Besides this Arundelian or Norfolk library,
which takes up a large room, another
curious and valuable collection was
left the society in the year 1715, by their
Secretary Francis Aston, Esq; which together
with the numerous benefactions of
the works of the learned members, in all
faculties, but more especially in natural
and experimental philosophy, amount to
above 3600, and are placed in glass cases
in another room.</p>

<p class='c004'>The museum belonging to the society,
was founded by Daniel Colwall, Esq; in
the year 1677, who gave his excellent collection
of natural and artificial curiosities,
which compose the greatest part of the
catalogue published in the year 1681, by
Dr. Grew, under the title of <i>Museum Regalis
Societatis</i>. But these curiosities, by
the generous benefactions of other curious
persons, are now increased to above six
times the number of those mentioned in
the catalogue.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Upon the society’s removal from Gresham
college to their house in Crane
court, Richard Waller, Esq; one of the
Secretaries, erected in the year 1711, at
his own expence, the repository in the
garden for the reception of the above curiosities,
which consist of the following
species, viz. human, quadrupedes, birds,
eggs, nests, fishes, insects, reptiles, woods,
stalks and roots; fruits of all sorts; mosses,
mushrooms, plants, spunges, &amp;c. animal
and vegetable bodies petrified; corals, and
other marine productions; fossils, gems,
stones, metals, antimony, mercury, and
other metallic bodies, salts, sulphurs, oils,
and earths; philosophical and mathematical
instruments; Indian, American, and
other weapons, with a variety of apparel,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c004'>In short, by the above Royal and other
benefactions, the admission money, and
annual contributions of the members, this
society was at length in so flourishing a
condition, that they applied to his late
Majesty King George I. for an additional
privilege to purchase in mortmain 1000<i>l.</i>
instead of 200<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>, which he was
pleased to grant by his letters patent, in
1725. Among the Fellows of this society
are his Majesty King George II. and many
of the greatest Princes in Europe.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>This learned body is governed by a
President and Council, consisting of
twenty-one Fellows, distinguished by
their rank and learning.</p>

<p class='c004'>The officers chosen from among the
members, are, the President, who calls
and dissolves the meetings, proposes the
subjects of consultation, puts questions,
calls for experiments, and admits the
members that are from time to time received
into the society.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Treasurer, who receives and disburses
all the money.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two Secretaries, who read all letters
and informations; reply to all addresses
or letters from foreign parts, or at home;
register all experiments and conclusions,
and publish what is ordered by the society.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Curators, who have the charge of
making experiments, receive the directions
of the society, and at another meeting
bring all to the test.</p>

<p class='c004'>Every person to be elected a Fellow of
the Royal Society, must be propounded
and recommended at a meeting of the society,
by three or more members; who
must then deliver to one of the Secretaries
a paper signed by themselves with their
own names, specifying the name, addition,
profession, occupation, and chief qualifications;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>the inventions, discoveries, works,
writings, or other productions of the candidate
for election; as also notifying the
usual place of his abode, and recommending
him on their own personal knowledge.
A fair copy of which paper, with
the date of the day when delivered, shall
be fixed up in the common meeting room
of the society, at ten several ordinary
meetings, before the said candidate shall
be put to the ballot: but it shall be free
for every one of his Majesty’s subjects,
who is a Peer, or the son of a Peer, of
Great Britain or Ireland, and for every
one of his Majesty’s Privy Council of either
of the said kingdoms, and for every
foreign Prince or Ambassador, to be propounded
by any single person, and to be
put to the ballot for election on the same
day, there being present a competent
number for making elections. And at
every such ballot, unless two thirds at least
of the members present give their bills in
favour of the candidate, he cannot be
elected a Fellow of the Royal Society;
nor can any candidate be balloted for, unless
twenty-one members at the least be
present.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a candidate has been elected, he
may at that, or the next meeting of the
society, be introduced, and solemnly admitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>by the President, after having previously
subscribed the obligation, whereby
he promises, “That he will endeavour
to promote the good of the Royal Society
of London, for the improvement
of natural knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When any one is admitted, he pays a
fee of five guineas, and afterwards 13<i>s.</i> a
quarter, as long as he continues a member,
towards defraying the expences of the society;
and for the payment thereof he
gives a bond; but most of the members
on their first admittance chuse to pay down
twenty guineas, which discharges them
from any future payments.</p>

<p class='c004'>Any Fellow may however free himself
from these obligations, by only writing to
the President, that he desires to withdraw
from the society.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the President takes the chair,
the rest of the Fellows take their seats,
and those who are not of the society withdraw:
except any Baron of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, any person of a
higher title, or any of his Majesty’s
Privy Council of any of his three kingdoms,
and any foreigner of eminent repute,
may stay, with the allowance of the
President, for that time; and upon leave
obtained of the President and Fellows
present, or the major part of them, any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>other person may be permitted to stay for
that time: but the name of every person
thus permitted to stay, that of the person
who moved for him, and the allowance,
are to be entered in the journal book.</p>

<p class='c004'>The business of the society in their ordinary
meetings, is, to order, take account,
consider and discourse of philosophical experiments
and observations; to read, hear,
and discourse upon letters, reports, and
other papers, containing philosophical
matters; as also to view and discourse
upon the rarities of nature and art, and to
consider what may be deduced from them,
and how far they may be improved for
use or discovery.</p>

<p class='c004'>No experiment can be made at the
charge of the society, but by order of
the society or council. And in order to
the propounding and making experiments
for the society, the importance of such
experiment is to be considered with respect
to the discovery of any truth, or to
the use and benefit of mankind.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Philosophical Transactions are
printed at the charge of the society, and
the Clerk delivers <i>gratis</i> one of the copies
to every Fellow of the Society who shall
demand it, either in person, or by letter under
the hand of such Fellow, within one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>year after the Clerk has begun to deliver
such copies.</p>

<p class='c004'>If any Fellow of the society shall contemptuously
or contumaciously disobey the
statutes or orders of the society; or shall
by speaking, writing, or printing, publicly
defame the society, or maliciously do
any thing to the detriment thereof, he
shall be ejected.</p>

<p class='c004'>The meetings of the Royal Society are
on Thursdays, at five o’clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c004'>The members of the Council are elected
out of the Fellows, upon the feast of
St. Andrew in the morning; when after
the election they all dine together.</p>

<p class='c004'>Eleven of the old council are chosen for
the ensuing year; and ten are elected
out of the other members. Then the
President, Treasurer, and Secretary are
elected out of these. But the same persons
are usually rechosen into these offices.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Russia Company</span>, a body of merchants
incorporated by letters patent, granted by
Queen Mary on the 6th of February
1555, by which they were not only impowered
to carry on an exclusive trade to
all parts of the Russian empire, but to all
such countries as they should discover in
those northern parts. In consequence of
this charter, they soon after discovered the
Cherry Islands, Greenland, Nova Zembla,
Newfoundland, Davis’s Streights, and
Hudson’s Bay; and their first Governor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>was that celebrated mariner Sebastian
Cabot.</p>

<p class='c004'>In consideration of these valuable discoveries,
their privileges were confirmed
by Parliament; and in the year 1614 enlarged
by King James I.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the year 1742, the Russia company
obtained leave of the present Czarina Elizabeth,
to trade with Persia thro’ Russia,
and between the years 1743 and 1749,
Mr. Hanway observes, they imported raw
silk to the amount of 93,375<i>l.</i> value in
Persia: but Mr. Elton, one of the company’s
agents, being employed by Kouli
Khan, who then sat on the Persian
throne, to build some ships of force on the
Caspian sea, the Russians apprehended they
should be disturbed by the Persians in their
navigation over that sea, and therefore
put an end to the traffic of the British
Russia company through Russia to Persia.</p>

<p class='c004'>This company exports cloth of all sorts,
both dressed and dyed; kersies, baize,
cottons, fustians, perpetuanoes, Norwich
stuffs, lace, thread, lead, tin, pewter,
allum, copper, and most other sorts of
English commodities: and we import
from thence, cordage, tar, tallow, potashes,
cable yarn, bees wax, linen cloth,

tanned and raw; hogs bristles, linseed,

of a Governor, four Consuls, and
twenty-four Assistants, annually chosen
on the 1st of March, who keep their
courts monthly, or as occasion requires, in
a large room in the Old East India house
in Leadenhall street: but considered as a
company, their trade at present is not very
considerable; it being carried on chiefly
by private merchants, who are admitted
to reap the profit of trading to Russia, on
paying 5<i>l.</i> each.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Saviour’s</span> <i>Bermondsey</i>, a priory, and afterwards
an abbey, founded by Alwin
Child, a citizen of London, in the year
1082, in the place now denominated
St. John’s court Bermondsey.</p>

<p class='c004'>This priory was not only confirmed by
the charter of William Rufus, together
with all the benefactions belonging to it;
but that Prince also conferred upon the
Prior and Monks the manor of Bermondsey,
and erected a handsome and spacious
conventual church for their accommodation.
This priory, however, being an
alien and a cell to one in France, it was
among other foreign foundations sequestered
by Edward III. in the year 1371,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>who constituted Richard Denton, an Englishman,
Prior thereof.</p>

<p class='c004'>This priory was in 1391 converted into
an abbey; and at the general suppression
of monasteries in the year 1539 was surrendered
to Henry VIII. when being
granted to Sir John Pope, he demolished
the old abbey, and erected in its room a
stately edifice, which some time after came
to the Earls of Sussex. <i>Stow’s Survey.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Saviour’s</span> <i>dock</i>, vulgarly called <i>Savory
dock</i>, in Rotherhith, took its name from
the above abbey, dedicated to the holy
Saviour. <i>Maitland.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Saviour’s</span> <i>Mill</i>, vulgarly called <i>Savory
mill</i>, also belonged to the above abbey, and
was in the year 1536 let by the Abbot
and Monks to John Curlew, at the yearly
rent of 6<i>l.</i> which was then the value of
eighteen quarters of good wheat; and he
was also bound to grind all the corn used
in the abbey.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the place where this mill stood, is
now an engine for raising water to supply
the neighbourhood. <i>Maitland.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Saviour’s</span> <i>School</i>, in St. Saviour’s
church yard, Southwark, was founded by
the parish, for the education of boys in
grammatical learning, and confirmed by
letters patent granted by Queen Elizabeth,
so early as the year 1562, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>fourth of her reign; by which six of the
vestry are for ever appointed Governors.</p>

<p class='c004'>To this school belong a Master and
Usher, the former of whom has a salary
of 30<i>l.</i> and the latter 20<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Saviour’s</span> <i>Southwark</i>, or <i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Mary
Overies</span>, a church of great antiquity,
situated to the south west of the bridge
foot. In the place where it stands, is
said to have been anciently a priory of
nuns founded by one Mary a Virgin, the
owner of a ferry over the river Thames,
before the building of London bridge.
Some time after the priory was converted
into a college of Priests; but that establishment,
as well as the former, proving
of no long duration, it was in the year
1106 founded by two Norman Knights,
and the Bishop of Winchester, for Canons
regular, and from its dedication to the
Virgin Mary, and its situation, was called
St. Mary Overie, that is, St. Mary over
the river.</p>

<p class='c004'>This edifice was destroyed by fire
about the year 1207; but it being soon
after rebuilt, Peter de Rupibus, Bishop of
Winchester, added to it a spacious chapel,
which he dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen;
and this being afterwards appointed
for the use of the inhabitants, it at last
became their parish church.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>The monastery and church were rebuilt
in the reigns of Richard II. and
Henry IV. but at the general suppression
of religious houses were surrendered to
Henry VIII. in the year 1539; upon
which the parishes of St. Mary Magdalen,
and St. Margaret, purchased the
conventual church of King Henry; and
were the next year united by act of Parliament,
and the church being then repaired,
was called by the new name of
St. Saviour’s. <i>Stowe.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>Both the construction and extent of
this Gothic structure resemble a cathedral
more than a parish church. The length
is 260 feet, and that of the cross isle 109:
the breadth of the body is 54 feet, and the
height of the tower, including the pinacles,
is 150 feet. The construction of
the windows, entrances, and every other
part, is purely in the Gothic style, except
a modern door, which is neither Gothic,
nor agreeable to the rules of any other
architecture. The tower, which is square,
and well proportioned, is supported by
massy pillars over the meeting of the
middle and cross isles; it is crowned with
battlements, and has a pinacle at each
corner.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a chapel at the east end of the
church is the monument of Bishop Andrews,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>who was interred there; and in
another part of the church is that of the
Bishop of Winchester; but the most singular
monument is that of the family of
the Austins, erected in the last century,
and repaired, new painted, and gilt by
the relations in 1706.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first figure is a rock, upon which is
written, <i>Petra erat</i> XTS. that is, The
rock was Christ. Down this rock runs a
stream of water; and out of it glides a
serpent, his old skin being stript off by
the rock, which is seen hanging on that
part of his back that is not yet got thro’.
At the foot of the rock there grows standing
corn, on which is a label with these
words, <i>Si non moriatur, non reviviscit</i>,
that is, If it dieth not, it liveth not again.
Underneath the corn is this motto, <i>Nos
sevit, fovit, lavit, coget, renovabit</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
He hath sown, cherished, washed us, and
shall gather us together and renew us.</p>

<p class='c004'>Upon the top of the rock stands an angel,
holding a sickle in his left hand, and
with his right pointing to the sun, which
shines, and on its lower rays is a label,
upon which is, <i>Sol justitiæ</i>, <i>i.e.</i> The Sun
of righteousness.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the sides of the monument are
scythes, flails, shepherds crooks, rakes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>ploughs, harrows, and other instruments
of husbandry hanging by a ribband out of
a Death’s head; and above them, <i>Vos estis
agricultura</i>, <i>i.e.</i> Ye are God’s husbandry.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the outside of these a harvest man
with wings is seated on each side, one
with a fork behind him, and the other
with a rake. They have straw hats, and
lean their heads upon their hands, the elbows
resting upon their knees, as if fatigued
with labour, and under them are
these words, <i>Messores congregabunt</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
The reapers shall gather. Under all is a
winnowing fan, upon which is stretched
a sheet of parchment bearing a long inscription
in Latin.</p>

<p class='c004'>Though the name of this church has
been changed from St. Mary Overies to
that of St. Saviour, yet the former still
prevails. It is a rectory in the gift of the
parish, and the profits arising to the two
Chaplains, are said to amount to above
300<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Savoy</span>, or <i>Lancaster Palace</i>, is situated to
the westward of Somerset house, between
the Strand and the Thames. This place
obtained the name of the Savoy, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Peter Earl of Savoy and Richmond, who
built it about the year 1245, and afterwards
transferred it to the friars of Montjoy,
of whom Queen Eleanor, the wife of
King Henry III. purchased it for her son
Henry Duke of Lancaster. The Duke
afterwards enlarged and beautified it, at
the expence of 52,000 marks, at that
time an immense sum. Here John King
of France resided, when a prisoner in
England in the year 1357, and upon his
return hither in 1363, when it was esteemed
one of the finest palaces in England.</p>

<p class='c004'>This edifice was burnt in 1381 by the
Kentish rebels, on account of some pique
they had conceived against John of Gaunt,
Duke of Lancaster, who was then the
proprietor. But the ground afterwards
devolving to the Crown, King Henry VII.
began to rebuild it as it at present appears,
for an hospital, for the reception of an
hundred distressed objects; but that Prince
not living to see it compleated, Henry
VIII. his son, not only granted his manor
of the Savoy to the Bishop of Winchester
and others, the executors of his father’s
will, towards finishing the hospital; but
by his charter of the 5th of July 1513,
constituted them a body politic and corporate,
to consist of a Master, five secular
Chaplains, and four Regulars, in honour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>of Jesus Christ, his Mother, and St. John
Baptist; the foundation to be denominated
<i>The hospital of King Henry VII. late
King of England, of the Savoy</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>This hospital was suppressed in the
reign of Edward VI. when the revenues
were found to amount to 530<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>,
which that Prince gave to the city of
London towards making a provision for
the hospitals of Bridewell, Christ-church,
and St. Thomas: but Queen Mary converted
it into an hospital again, and having
endowed it anew, her Ladies and Maids of
honour completely furnished it, at their
own expence, with all necessaries. However
the hospital was again suppressed upon
the accession of Queen Elizabeth to
the throne, and the revenues applied to
the uses intended by her brother.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nothing here is now to be seen, but
the ruins of the ancient edifice built with
free-stone and flints, among which is still
remaining part of a great building, in
which detachments of the King’s guards
lie, and where they have their Marshalsea
prison for the confinement of deserters
and other offenders, and to lodge their
recruits.</p>

<p class='c004'>A part of the Savoy was assigned by
King William III. for the residence of the
French refugees, who have still a chapel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>here, in which they conform to the
church of England. <i>Stowe.</i> <i>Dugdale’s

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Schools.</span> Of these we have given an account

foundations; the most famous and noble
of these, are, the Charterhouse, Mercers
school, Merchant Taylors school, St.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>Paul’s school, and Westminster school;
and among those for the instruction of the
lower class, is Christ-church school, a
noble foundation for the education and
support of the children of deceased citizens,
and a great number of smaller
foundations, as, St. Olave’s school, Ratcliff
school, Tothill fields school, and several
others; all of which the reader
may find under their respective articles.</p>

<p class='c004'>In these schools, exclusive of Christ-church
hospital, are educated 2888 boys,
and 285 girls; the charge of whose education,
&amp;c. exclusive of those which belong
to hospitals and almshouses, amounts,
according to Maitland, to the annual sum
of 1990<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>Besides these, which are supported by
regular funds, there are a great number
denominated <span class='sc'>Charity Schools</span>, that
have no other foundation and support,
than generous benefactions, annual subscriptions,
and the charitable collections
made in the several churches in this city
and suburbs. Of these we shall give a
list, with the number of the boys and
girls in each.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>Thus in these charity schools are educated
3458 boys, and 1901 girls, in all
5359. Mr. Maitland has been at some
pains in endeavouring to learn the respective
charges of the above schools;
but not being able to obtain an account of
each, he has endeavoured to settle as near
as possible the expence of maintaining the
whole, and that by a method equally
plain and satisfactory: for having found
that the parish school of St. Andrew’s,
Holborn, which contains eighty boys,
cost in one year 272<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> and seventy
girls in the same school 139<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> he
computed, that as the charge of eighty
boys amounts to 272<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> so that of
3458 boys must amount to 11,763<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i>
10¼<i>d.</i> and so, by the same method of
calculation, as the expence of seventy
girls amounts to 139<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> that of
1901 girls must amount to 3794<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>
7½<i>d. per annum</i>; whence it appears, that
the whole expence of all the said charity
children amounts to 15,557<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 5¾<i>d.</i>
<i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The same author adds, that the annual
expence of the above free-schools, exclusive
of those belonging to the hospitals
and almshouses, amounting to 1990<i>l.</i> it
appears that the expence of these schools,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>added to that of the charity schools,
amount in all to 17,547<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 3¾<i>d.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Scots Corporation</span>, for the relief of
poor and necessitous people of that
country. This corporation owes its origin
to James Kinnier, a Scotsman, and
merchant of this city; who on his recovery
from a long and dangerous illness,
resolved to give part of his estate towards
the relief of the aged and necessitous of
his country, within the cities of London
and Westminster: and having prevailed
with a society of his countrymen, who
composed a box club, to join their stock,
applied for a charter, by which he and his
co-adjutors were, in the year 1665, constituted
a body politic and corporate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>with several privileges, which King
Charles II. confirmed the following year
by letters patent, wherein are recited the
privileges granted in the former charter,
with the addition of several new ones,
viz.</p>

<p class='c004'>That they might erect an hospital
within the city or liberties of London and
Westminster, to be called, <i>The Scots hospital
of King Charles II.</i> to be governed by
eight Scotsmen, who were to chuse from
among themselves a Master, who, together
with these Governors, were declared
to be a body politic and corporate, and to
have a common seal. They were also
impowered to elect thirty-three Assistants,
and to purchase in mortmain 400<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>, over and above an annual sum
mentioned in the first charter; the profits
arising from these purchases to be employed
in relieving poor old Scots men
and women, and instructing and employing
poor Scottish orphans, the descendants
of Scotsmen within this city.</p>

<p class='c004'>This humane foundation had however
like to have been crushed in its bud by
two very dreadful events, the plague, and
the fire of London; which happened in
the very years when the charters were
granted. However, those who had the
direction of the work began in the year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>1670 to prosecute it with vigour; and
found themselves not only in a condition
to provide for their poor, but took a lease
of a piece of ground in Black Friars, to
build upon, for the term of a thousand
years, at a ground-rent of 40<i>l.</i> and by
charitable contributions were enabled to
erect their hall, with two houses at Fleetditch,
and four in Black Friars, which
were soon after finished at the expence of
4450<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>All matters relating to the corporation
are managed by the Governors without
fee or reward; for they not only, upon all
such occasions, spend their own money,
but contribute quarterly for the support of
the society, and the relief of the poor;
they provide for the sick; to the reduced
and aged they grant pensions; they bury
the dead, and give money to such as are
disposed to return to Scotland. The sums
disbursed by the society amount to about
600<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The officers belonging to this corporation

<p class='c011'><i>The Office for the relief of</i> <span class='sc'>Sea Officers
Widows</span>. The Lords of the Admiralty
having taken into consideration, the unhappy
condition to which the widows of
many of the officers of the navy were reduced
by the death of their husbands,
proposed both to the commissioned and
half-pay officers of the navy, to enter into
a voluntary agreement, to grant three
pence in the pound out of their pay, towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>establishing a fund for allowing
pensions to such of their widows as are
left in mean circumstances.</p>

<p class='c004'>To this the officers readily consenting,
the Lords Commissioners laid the affair
before his present Majesty, who, to promote
so good a work, granted his letters
patent in the year 1732, directing that
three pence in the pound be deducted
from the pay and half-pay of all commission
and warrant officers of the navy;
and to appoint the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, the Treasurer, Commissioners,
Paymaster, and Cashier of the
navy, for the time being, twenty Captains,
ten Lieutenants, five Masters, five Boatswains,
five Gunners, five Carpenters, five
Pursers, and five Surgeons of the navy,
the eldest of their respective stations, to be
Governors of this corporation: out of
whom are appointed a President, two Vice
Presidents, a Treasurer, and fifteen Assistants,
as a committee for the management
of all the affairs belonging to this
charity.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first Commissioner of the Admiralty
is to be always President; and the
Treasurer of the navy to be always the
Treasurer; but the two Vice Presidents,
and fifteen Assistants, are to be elected annually.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>By the orders of this generous corporation,
no officer or servant employed
therein, is to receive any salary, reward,
or gratuity; the whole business being
transacted <i>gratis</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first step taken by the Governors
was providing for the widows whose husbands
died after the date of the above
letters patent; who, in the first year
amounted to twenty-four, to whom pensions
were allowed, according to the following
regulations, viz. To the widow of
a Captain, 45<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>; to the widow
of a Lieutenant or Master, 30<i>l.</i> and to the
widow of a Boatswain, Gunner, Carpenter,
Purser, Surgeon, second Master of a
yacht, or Master of a naval vessel appointed
by the navy board, 20<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Lords Commissioners afterwards
commiserating the unhappy circumstances
of many poor widows, whose husbands
died before this corporation was established,
and therefore could receive no benefit
from the fund which was justly appropriated
to the relief of the widows of those
officers who had paid to its support, renewed
their application to his Majesty,
who recommended their case to the Parliament;
upon which it was enacted, that
one seaman should be allowed upon the
books of every ship of war, in the sea-pay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>in every hundred men that its complement
should consist of, and that the produce
of the wages of such seamen, and
the value of their victuals should be given
and applied towards the relief of poor
widows of commission and warrant officers
of the royal navy.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Secretary of State’s Office</span>, Whitehall.
The Kings of England had anciently
no more than one Secretary of
state, till about the end of the reign of
Henry VIII. when it was thought proper
that this important office should be discharged
by two persons of equal authority,
both stiled <i>Principal Secretaries of
state</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>At that time they did not sit at the
council board; but having prepared their
business in a room adjoining to the council
chamber, they came in, and stood on either
hand of the King; when nothing
was done till they had gone through with
their proposals. But Queen Elizabeth
seldom coming to council, that method
was laid aside, and the Secretaries took
their places as Privy Counsellors, which
dignity they have enjoyed ever since, and
a Council is seldom, or never, held without
the presence of, at least, one of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their employment rendering their office
a place of extraordinary trust, this, together
with the multiplicity of their business,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>places them in a distinguished light,
both in respect to the King and the people:
for they attend almost every day upon his
Majesty, as occasion requires; the petitions
of the people are for the most part
lodged in their hands, to be presented to
the King; and, in return, they make the
dispatches, according to his Majesty’s answers
and determinations.</p>

<p class='c004'>The correspondence to all parts of
Great Britain without distinction, relating
to the church, the army, the militia,
grants, pardons, dispensations, &amp;c. is managed
by either of the Secretaries. But
as to foreign affairs, all the nations that
have any intercourse with Great Britain,
are divided by them into two provinces,
the northern and southern, each being under
one of the Secretaries, as his separate
department. They have this special honour,
that if either of them be a Baron,
he takes place, and has the precedence of
all other persons of the same degree, tho’
by creation they might have a right to precede
him: but if he is above the degree
of a Baron, he then takes place only according
to the seniority of his creation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Each of the Secretaries have lodgings
appointed for them in all the King’s
houses; both for their own accommodation,
for their office, and for those that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>attend upon it. They have each a salary
of 3000<i>l.</i> a year; which, added to their
lawful perquisites, is said to make their
places worth 8000<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i> each.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Secretaries and Clerks they employ
under them are wholly at their own
choice, and have no dependence upon any
other person. These are,</p>

<p class='c004'>In the northern department, two Under
Secretaries and Keepers of state papers, a
first Clerk, and ten other Clerks, a Gazette
writer, who has 300<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>;
and a Secretary for the Latin tongue,
whose salary is 200<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the southern department are, two
Under Secretaries, a first Clerk, seven
other Clerks; and a Law Clerk to both,
who has a salary of 400<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Secretaries of state have also the
custody of the King’s seal, called the signet;
the use and application of which
gives denomination to another office, called
the Signet office. See the article
<span class='sc'>Signet Office</span>.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is also another office depending
on the Secretaries of state, called the Paper
office; for which see that article.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span><i>St.</i> <span class='sc'>Sepulchre’s</span>, on the north side of the
top of Snow hill near Newgate, and in
the ward of Faringdon without, owes its
name to its being dedicated in commemoration
of Christ’s sepulchre at Jerusalem.
It is of great antiquity, and was
probably founded during the time, when
all Europe were employed in crusades to
the holy land; however, about the beginning
of the twelfth century, it was
given by the Bishop of Salisbury to the
Prior and Canons of St. Bartholomew
in Smithfield, who, in virtue of that
grant, had the right of advowson till the
dissolution of their monastery, when coming
to the Crown, it continued therein
till King James I. in the year 1610,
granted the rectory and its appurtenances,
with the advowson of the vicarage, to
Francis Philips and others; after which
the rectory with its appurtenances were
purchased by the parishioners, to be held
in fee-farm of the Crown, while the advowson
was obtained by the President and
Fellows of St. John Baptist’s college in
Oxford, in whom the patronage still continues.
<i>Dugd. Mon. Ang.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>The present structure was much damaged,
though not destroyed by the fire
of London; after which it was thoroughly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>repaired in 1670, when nothing of the
old building, except the walls, was
suffered to remain, and not those entirely.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is a very spacious church, it being
126 feet long, besides a broad passage
through at the west end; the breadth is
fifty-eight feet, exclusive of the north
chapel; the height of the roof in the
middle isle is thirty-five feet, and the
height of the steeple to the top of the pinacles,
is 146 feet. The whole length of
the side is in a manner taken up by a row
of very large Gothic windows, with buttresses
between, over which runs a slight
cornice, and on the top a plain and substantial
battlement work. The steeple is
a plain square tower crowned with four
pinacles.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wall of this church yard, till very
lately, extended so far into the street all
along the south side of the church, as to
render the passage narrow and dangerous;
but after the church yard on that side had
been shut up about fourteen years, it was
levelled, and laid open to the street in the
beginning of the present year 1760.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Vicar of this church, besides other
advantages, receives 200<i>l.</i> in money in
lieu of tithes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Munday, in his edition of Stow’s Survey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>mentions the following monumental
inscription in this church.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Before we conclude this article, it may
be proper to observe, that in the year
1605, Mr. Robert Dew gave by deed of
gift, fifty pounds to this parish, on condition
that for ever after, a person should go
to Newgate, in the still of the night before
every execution day, and standing as near
the cells of the condemned prisoners as
possible, should, with a hand bell, (which
he also gave for that purpose) give twelve
solemn tolls with double strokes, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>after a proper pause, deliver with an audible
voice the following words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You prisoners that are within,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Who for wickedness and sin,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c030'>After many mercies shewn you, are
now appointed to die to-morrow in the
forenoon, give ear and understand, that
to-morrow morning the greatest bell of
St. Sepulchre’s shall toll for you in form
and manner of a passing bell, as used to
be tolled for those at the point of
death: to the end that all godly people
hearing that bell, and knowing it is for
your going to your deaths, may be
stirred up heartily to pray to God to bestow
his grace and mercy upon you
whilst you live.</p>

<p class='c030'>“I beseech you, for Jesus Christ’s sake,
to keep this night in watching and
prayer, for the salvation of your own
souls, while there is yet time and place
for mercy; as knowing to-morrow you
must appear before the judgment seat
of your Creator, there to give an account
of all things done in this life, and
to suffer eternal torments for your sins
committed against him, unless upon
your hearty and unfeigned repentance,
you find mercy through the merits,
death, and passion of your only mediator
and advocate Jesus Christ, who now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>sits at the right hand of God to make
intercession for as many of you as penitently
return to him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He likewise ordered that St. Sepulchre’s
great bell should toll, till it was supposed
these unhappy prisoners were executed;
and that as the criminals passed by the
wall of St. Sepulchre’s church yard, to
execution, the same bellman should look
over it, and say:</p>
<p class='c009'>“All good people, pray
heartily unto God for these poor sinners,
who are now going to their death,
for whom this great bell doth toll.</p>

<p class='c030'>“You that are condemned to die, repent
with lamentable tears: ask mercy
of the Lord for the salvation of your
own souls, through the merits, death,
and passion of Jesus Christ, who now
sits at the right hand of God, to make
intercession for as many of you as penitently
return unto him.”</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c031'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Lord, have mercy upon you,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Christ, have mercy upon you,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Lord, have mercy upon you,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Christ, have mercy upon you.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>For this service the bellman or sexton
receives 1<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a year; but upon these
occasions there is generally so much noise,
that nobody can hear one word that the
bellman says.</p>

<span class='sc'>Sergeants at Law.</span> The highest degree
of lawyers under a Judge. The
young student in the common law, when
admitted to be of one of the inns of court,
is called a <i>Moot-man</i>, and after about seven
years study, is chosen an Utter Barrister,
and is then capable of being made a
Sergeant at law.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the number of Sergeants is small,
the Lord Chief Justice of the Common
Pleas, by the advice and consent of the
other Judges, chuses about six or eight of
the most learned persons of the Inns of
court, and presents their names to the
Lord Chancellor, or Lord Keeper, who
sends to each of them the King’s writ to
appear on a particular day before the
King, to receive the degree of a Sergeant at
law.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the time appointed, they being
dressed in robes of two colours, brown and
blue, they go, attended by the students of
the Inns of court, with a train of servants
and retainers, dressed in peculiar liveries,
to Westminster hall, where they publicly
take a solemn oath, and are cloathed with
robes and coifs, without which they are
from thenceforward never to appear in
public. After this they give a great entertainment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>to the principal persons of the
nation; and present gold rings to the
Princes of the blood, the Archbishops,
the Lord Chancellor, and the Treasurer,
to the value of forty shillings each ring;
to the Earls and Bishops rings of 20<i>s.</i>
and to other great officers, Barons, &amp;c.
rings of less value, besides a great number
of rings to their private friends.</p>

Here is an hospital and school, for the
maintenance of people in years, and the

in the year 1418, who is said to have
been a foundling supported and educated

The school afterwards met with other
benefactors, and among the rest, Queen
Elizabeth having greatly augmented its
revenue, it was thence called Queen Elizabeth’s

1727. Sir Henry Fermor, Bart. has a

of Stepney, is now a distinct parish, and
by the great increase of buildings is united
to this metropolis. This parish, which is
one of the Tower hamlets, is situated on
the north bank of the Thames, and received
its name from a fine spring which
issues from the south wall of the church
yard. The parish is, from its situation,
divided into Upper and Lower Shadwell,
Lower Shadwell being anciently a part of
Wapping marsh.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the north east of this parish is Sun tavern
fields, where a Roman cemetery, or
burying place, was discovered about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>year 1615, wherein were found two coffins,
one of which being of stone, contained
the bones of a man; and the other
of lead, finely embellished with scallop
shells, and a crotister border, contained
those of a woman, at whose head and feet
were two urns, each three feet high; and
at the sides several beautiful red earthen
bottles, with a number of lachrymatories
of hexagon and octagon forms. On each
side of the inhumed bones were two ivory
scepters of the length of eighteen inches
each, and upon the breast the figure of a
small Cupid, curiously wrought; as were
likewise two pieces of jet resembling
nails, three inches in length. According
to the opinion of that judicious antiquary
Sir Robert Cotton, who made this discovery,
the person here interred must have
been the wife of some Prince, or Roman
Prætor, by the decorations of the coffin
and the things contained in it.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this place were likewise discovered
several urns, with Roman coins, which
had on one side this Inscription, <i>Imp.
Pupienus Maximus P. F.</i> and on the reverse,
with hands joined, <i>Patrus Senatus</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>A few years ago was also discovered in
this place a mineral spring, said to be impregnated
with sulphur, vitriol, steel, and
antimony. It is esteemed a great anti-scorbutic,
and is said to have performed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>many remarkable cures in the leprosy,
scurvy, scald heads, and other cutaneous
diseases.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sherburn</span> <i>lane</i>, Lombard street; thus
named from the brook Langbourn, which
anciently ran out of Fenchurch street, and
here turning south, divided into several
shares, rills, or streams. This lane was
also anciently called Southbourn lane, because
these rills here ran south to the
Thames. <i>Maitland.</i></p>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sheriffs</span>, two very ancient officers of the
city, established in the time of the Saxons:
but Richard I. changed the name of these
officers to the Norman appellation of
Bailiff, which signifies an Intendant, Collector,
or petty Magistrate; as the Saxon
Sciregrave implies a Judge, Overseer, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Collector. However, the appellation of
Bailiff proving of no long duration, the
more ancient one of Sheriff was restored to
that office.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Sheriffs are chosen by the Liverymen
of the several companies on Midsummer
day, the Lord Mayor drinking to
those whom he nominates for their approbation:
but any person who can swear
that he is not worth 15000<i>l.</i> may be excused
from serving the office; however, if
he is qualified with respect to fortune, he
is obliged to serve, or to pay a fine of about
500<i>l.</i> or otherwise to engage in a law suit
with the city. This last is particularly
the case of the dissenters, who look upon
themselves as disqualified by law; since
by act of Parliament, every person who
serves the office of Sheriff ought to have
received the sacrament in the church of
England, twelve months before he enters
upon his office.</p>

<p class='c004'>Any gentleman of the city may be
chosen an Alderman, without his serving
the office of Sheriff; but he is obliged
to be a Sheriff before he can be Lord
Mayor.</p>

<p class='c004'>The office of Sheriff, according to our
great antiquary Mr. Camden, is to collect
the public revenues within his jurisdiction,
to gather into the Exchequer all
fines, to serve the King’s writs of process,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>and by the <i>posse comitatus</i> to compel headstrong
and obstinate men to submit to the
decisions of the law; to attend the Judges,
and execute their orders, to impanel juries,
and to take care that all condemned
criminals be duly executed.</p>

<p class='c004'>All actions for debt in the city are entered
at the two compters belonging to
the Sheriffs, where the prisoners either
give bail, or are confined in prison, unless
being freemen, they chuse to be carried to
Ludgate. See the article <span class='sc'>Compter</span>.</p>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sheriffs Courts</span>, are courts of record
held in Guildhall every Wednesday and
Friday, for actions entered in Wood street
Compter, and on Thursdays and Saturdays
for those entered at the Poultry Compter,
of which the Sheriffs being Judges, each
has his Assistant or Deputy, who are commonly
called Judges of these courts, before
whom are tried actions of debt, trespass,
covenant, &amp;c. where the testimony
of an absent witness in writing is allowed
to be good evidence. <i>Maitland.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>To each of these courts belong four
Attorneys, a Secondary, a Clerk of the
papers, a Prothonotary, and four Clerks
sitters. See the article <span class='sc'>Compter</span>.</p>

<p class='c004'>This corporation consists of a Master,

highway, by the Saxons denominated
Eald street, or Old street, and according
to Maitland, owes its name to one of the
predecessors of Sir John Sordig, or Sordich,
who was Lord thereof in the year
1339, and not, as vulgarly supposed, to
Jane Shore, concubine to Edward IV.
This village was at a considerable distance

now joined to it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Signet Office</span>, Whitehall; an office under
the Principal Secretaries of state, who
have the custody of the King’s seal, called
the signet; the use and application whereof
gives name to this office, which constantly
attends the court.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this office there are four chief Clerks,
and two Deputies. These chief Clerks
wait alternately by months, and prepare
such writings as are to pass the signet.
They have no fee from the King, but only
200<i>l.</i> a year board wages. One of them
always attends the court wheresoever it
removes, and, by warrant from his Majesty,
prepares such bills or letters for the
King to sign, as not being matter of law,
they are directed by warrant to prepare.</p>

<p class='c004'>In their office all grants, either prepared
by the King’s Counsel at law, or by themselves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>for the King’s hand, when signed,
are returned, and there transcribed again;
and that transcript is carried to one of the
Principal Secretaries of state, and sealed;
and then it is called a signet. This being
directed to the Lord Privy Seal, is his
warrant for issuing out a privy seal upon
it. Privy seals for money, however, now
always begin in the Treasury, from whence
the first warrant issues, counter-signed by
the Lord Treasurer: but when the nature
of the grant requires the passing of the
great seal, then the privy seal is an authority
to the Lord Chancellor, to pass the
great seal; as the signet was to the Lord
Privy Seal to affix that seal to the grant.
But in all these three offices, the signet,
privy seal, and great seal, the grant is
transcribed; and therefore every thing
which passes from the King has these several
ways of being considered before it is
perfected. <i>Chamberlain’s Present State.</i></p>
